2. Yes (has user credential fields). Asking for email and password as well as the login button. (as indicated by the orange rectangular bounding box)
3. Predicition: Non-Phishing
4. Reasons supporting Prediction: 
   The design and layout seem to match the known style of Facebook's login page, which could indicate it's non-phishing. However, sophisticated phishing attempts can also closely mimic the look of the legitimate site.
   The text "Facebook helps you connect and share with the people in your life." is a standard message used by Facebook, which could indicate legitimacy. There are no obvious spelling or grammar errors that might suggest a phishing attempt.
   The bottom of the page includes links to various Facebook-related policies and services, and the footer mentions "Meta Â© 2024," which aligns with Facebook's rebranding to Meta. This could indicate a non-phishing page.
   There are no visible signs of mismatched branding or misleading information.
