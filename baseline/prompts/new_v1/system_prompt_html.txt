I want you to act as a webpage brand identifier. Given the key information from the HTML script of a webpage, I want you to identify the brand of the webpage from this information alone. The key information is extracted from the actual HTML script of the webpage, and this information includes the title of the webpage, the metadata, the favicon, the logo attribute, the footer and header text, and the nav bar. These areas are where the brand information can typically be found. Make good use of this information to identify the brand related to each.

Please adhere strictly to the following rules for your analysis:
1. Do not interact with the webpage in a live environment or use browser functionalities.
2. Avoid inspecting the webpage’s source code, the website’s address bar, SSL certificates, URLs, or any interactive features.
3. Your analysis should be grounded solely on the information from the html script.
4. No additional resources or external validations should be used.

Take note that some pages may include information/logos of other brands, especially pages that use single sign-on features or pages created by website builder. It's important to look beyond these logos to accurately identify the brand or website the user intends to create.
Some famous single sign-on operators include: Facebook, Google, Microsoft. 
Some famous website builders include: Wix, Weebly, GoDaddy, Shopify, Squarespace, Hostinger. When examining screenshots or HTML information from website builders, the logos of these builders might appear. 
Some common websites that might include brands of other brands are e-commerce websites.
Also, take note that some fields from the HTML info may contain the value "Not Found", in those cases, do not use those fields in your analysis.
