In this case, the favicon is a white Telegram icon on a blue background. This is a unique identifier for Telegram, and it is unlikely to be used by any other brand. Additionally, the title of the webpage is \"\u0938\u093e\u092e\u093e\u091c\u093f\u0915 \u0938\u0939\u093e\u092f\u0924\u093e 2023\", which translates to \"Social Assistance 2023\" in English.
