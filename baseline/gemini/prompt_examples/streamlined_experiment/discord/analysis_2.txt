7. Supporting_Evidence: The image did not show any logo, but from my background knowledge, this page has design similar to Discord page. Also there is a text "Discord" in the sentence "Scan this with the Discord mobile app to log in instantly" and also a QR code with a discord logo in it. All these signifies that this is a Discord page. The credentials and buttons can be found to the left of the QR code.
