The screenshot prominently displays the Outlook logo, consisting of an O and an envelope, which is the widely recognized symbol for Microsoft's Outlook email service. The word Outlook is also displayed next to the logo, further confirming the brand identity. Below the logo, there are two fields, labeled in Chinese characters, which translate to Email and Password, respectively. These are the standard credential fields for logging into an email service. There is also a call-to-action present, in the form of a sign in link/button, which is stylized with the Outlook branding colors and an accompanying icon. The confidence in brand identification is absolute due to the unmistakable Outlook logo and clear branding elements that match Microsoft's design language for its email service. Additionally, the layout, typography, and style are consistent with Outlook's official login page. There is no conflicting branding or elements that would suggest any other brand is represented on this page.
The screenshot displays the AT&T logo prominently at the top, which is the main factor in identifying the brand. This logo is a well-known trademark of AT&T, a large telecommunications company. Under the logo, there is a sign-in form with fields for Email and Password, indicating that the webpage is asking for user credentials. Just below the credential fields is a SIGN IN button, which serves as the call-to-action element. It prompts the user to proceed with the action of signing into their account. My confidence in identifying the brand is high due to the clear visibility of the AT&T logo, but not absolute because there's always a possibility of webpage spoofing or use of the logo in a third-party context (e.g., a service portal for AT&T services created by a different company). There is no evidence of other brands being primary on this page. The presence of the 'weebly.' at the bottom suggests that the webpage may have been created using the Weebly website-building platform, which does not necessarily affect the identification of the primary brand represented in the screenshot. The design of the sign-in form is straightforward, with no additional elements that might suggest a different brand or service.
The screenshot showcases the Meta logo, which is the parent company of Facebook. The logo is located at the top left corner of the page. Although there are other logos from Twitter, Instagram and Linkedin, but the brand associated with this page is Facebook.
