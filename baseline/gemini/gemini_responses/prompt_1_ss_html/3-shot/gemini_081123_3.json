The confidence score is given as 9.5 due to the clear visual representation of the ABANCA brand through the logo and the typical login fields associated with many of its login pages.",

Just below the credential fields is a \"LANJUT\" button, which serves as the call-to-action element. It prompts the user to proceed with the action of signing into their account. My confidence in identifying the brand is high due to the clear visibility of the Bank BTN logo, but not absolute because there's always a possibility of webpage spoofing or use of the logo in a third-party context (e.g., a service portal for Bank BTN services created by a different company). There is no evidence of other brands being primary on this page.",
