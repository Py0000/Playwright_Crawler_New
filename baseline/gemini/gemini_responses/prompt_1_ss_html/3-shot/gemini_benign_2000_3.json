The confidence score is given as 9.0 due to the clear visual representation of the Trellix brand through the logo and the typical login fields associated with many of its login pages. However, the presence of \"POWERED BY weebly\" at the bottom introduces a slight uncertainty because Weebly is a website creation platform and not typically associated with Trellix's official login pages, which might indicate this is a third-party webpage using Trellix's login for authentication purposes or a custom Trellix page created with Weebly.",

The presence of the \"SE CONNECTER\" button, which translates to \"LOG IN\" in English, functions as a call-to-action for users to submit their credentials to access their Entrust account. The confidence score is given as 9.0 due to the clear visual representation of the Entrust brand through the logo and the typical login fields associated with many of its login pages. However, the presence of \"POWERED BY weebly\" at the bottom introduces a slight uncertainty because Weebly is a website creation platform and not typically associated with Entrust's official login pages, which might indicate this is a third-party webpage using Entrust's login for authentication purposes or a custom Entrust page created with Weebly.",

The presence of the \"SE CONNECTER\" button, which translates to \"LOG IN\" in English, functions as a call-to-action for users to submit their credentials to access their D2L account. The confidence score is given as 9.0 due to the clear visual representation of the D2L brand through the logo and the typical login fields associated with many of its login pages. However, the presence of \"POWERED BY weebly\" at the bottom introduces a slight uncertainty because Weebly is a website creation platform and not typically associated with D2L's official login pages, which might indicate this is a third-party webpage using D2L's login for authentication purposes or a custom D2L page created with Weebly.",

Just below the credential fields is an \"Accedi\" button, which translates to \"LOG IN\" in English, functions as a call-to-action for users to submit their credentials to access their INPS account. The confidence score is given as 9.5 due to the clear visual representation of the INPS brand through the logo and the typical login fields associated with many of its login pages. However, the presence of \"Powered by Aruba PEC\" at the bottom introduces a slight uncertainty because Aruba PEC is a third-party service provider, which might indicate this is a third-party webpage using INPS's login for authentication purposes or a custom INPS page created with Aruba PEC.",

The presence of the \"SE CONNECTER\" button, which translates to \"LOG IN\" in English, functions as a call-to-action for users to submit their credentials to access their UpToDate account. The confidence score is given as 9.0 due to the clear visual representation of the UpToDate brand through the logo and the typical login fields associated with many of its login pages. However, the presence of \"POWERED BY weebly\" at the bottom introduces a slight uncertainty because Weebly is a website creation platform and not typically associated with UpToDate's official login pages, which might indicate this is a third-party webpage using UpToDate's login for authentication purposes or a custom UpToDate page created with Weebly.",

The presence of the \"SE CONNECTER\" button, which translates to \"LOG IN\" in English, functions as a call-to-action for users to submit their credentials to access their Entrust account. The confidence score is given as 9.0 due to the clear visual representation of the Entrust brand through the logo and the typical login fields associated with many of its login pages. However, the presence of \"POWERED BY weebly\" at the bottom introduces a slight uncertainty because Weebly is a website creation platform and not typically associated with Entrust's official login pages, which might indicate this is a third-party webpage using Entrust's login for authentication purposes or a custom Entrust page created with Weebly.",
