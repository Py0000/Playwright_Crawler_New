        "Supporting Evidence": "The screenshot displays the Microsoft logo prominently at the top of the page, which is the main factor in identifying the brand. This logo is a well-known trademark of Microsoft, a large technology company. Below the logo, there is a message indicating that a secure link has been received and requires the user to enter their email address to view a proposal. This email field is clearly labeled and is the only field requesting user input. The presence of the \"Next\" button, which is typically associated with proceeding to the next step in a process, serves as the call-to-action element. The design of the page is clean and straightforward, with a clear focus on the task of entering the email address. There are no additional elements or branding that would suggest a different brand or service is being represented on this page.",

        "Supporting Evidence": "The webpage screenshot displays the Facebook logo prominently at the top of the page, which is a well-known symbol for the social media platform Facebook. This logo is central on the page and is the main identifier for the brand. Beneath the logo, there are fields labeled in Polish, \"Numer telefonu kom\u00f3rkowego lub adres\" (Phone number or email) and \"Has\u0142o\" (Password), which clearly indicate that the page is designed for users to enter their login credentials. The presence of the \"Zaloguj si\u0119\" button, which translates to \"Log In\" in English, functions as a call-to-action for users to submit their credentials to access their Facebook account. The confidence score is given as 9.0 due to the clear visual representation of the Facebook brand through the logo and the typical login fields associated with many of its login pages. However, the presence of \"auta-konarski.pl\" at the bottom introduces a slight uncertainty because it is not a typical Facebook domain.",
