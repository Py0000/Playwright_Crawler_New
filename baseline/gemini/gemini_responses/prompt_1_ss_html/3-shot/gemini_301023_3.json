        "Supporting Evidence": "The webpage screenshot displays the BellMTS logo prominently at the top, which is the primary indicator of the brand. The logo is a stylized blue \"B\" with \"BellMTS\" written in a modern font below it. This logo is widely recognized in Canada, where BellMTS is a major telecommunications company. Beneath the logo, there is a sign-in form with fields for \"Email Address\" and \"Password,\" indicating that the page is designed for users to enter their login credentials. The presence of the \"[LOG IN]\" button, which is a standard call-to-action for login pages, further supports the purpose of the webpage. The confidence in identifying the brand is high due to the clear visibility of the BellMTS logo and the typical login fields associated with many of its login pages. However, the presence of \"POWERED BY Weebly\" at the bottom introduces a slight uncertainty because Weebly is a website creation platform and not typically associated with BellMTS's official login pages, which might indicate this is a third-party webpage using BellMTS's login for authentication purposes or a custom BellMTS page created with Weebly.",

        "Supporting Evidence": "The webpage screenshot displays the bet365 logo prominently at the top of the page, which is the main factor in identifying the brand. This logo is a well-known trademark of bet365, a large online gambling company. Below the logo, there is a sign-up form with fields for \"Username\" and \"Password,\" indicating that the page is asking for user credentials. Just below the credential fields is a \"\u514d\u8d39\u6ce8\u518c\" button, which translates to \"Sign Up\" in English, which serves as the call-to-action element. It prompts the user to proceed with the action of creating an account. My confidence in identifying the brand is high due to the clear visibility of the bet365 logo, but not absolute because there's always a possibility of webpage spoofing or use of the logo in a third-party context (e.g., a service portal for bet365 services created by a different company). There is no evidence of other brands being primary on this page.",
