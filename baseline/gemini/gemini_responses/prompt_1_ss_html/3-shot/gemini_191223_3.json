Just below the credential fields is a \"LOGIN\" button, which serves as the call-to-action element. It prompts the user to proceed with the action of signing into their account. My confidence in identifying the brand is high due to the clear visibility of the DHL logo, but not absolute because there's always a possibility of webpage spoofing or use of the logo in a third-party context (e.g., a service portal for DHL services created by a different company). There is no evidence of other brands being primary on this page.",
