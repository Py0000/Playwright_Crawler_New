Just below the credential fields is a \"CONNEXION\" button, which translates to \"LOG IN\" in English, serving as the call-to-action element. It prompts the user to proceed with the action of signing into their Instagram account. The confidence in identifying the brand is high due to the clear visibility of the Instagram logo and the typical login fields associated with its official login pages. However, the presence of \"POWERED BY weebly\" at the bottom introduces a slight uncertainty because Weebly is a website creation platform and not typically associated with Instagram's official login pages, which might indicate this is a third-party webpage using Instagram's login for authentication purposes or a custom Instagram page created with Weebly.",
