        "Supporting Evidence": "The screenshot displays the Credit Agricole logo prominently at the top, which is the main factor in identifying the brand. This logo is a well-known trademark of Credit Agricole, a large banking group in France. Under the logo, there is a sign-in form with fields for \"Email\" and \"Password,\" indicating that the webpage is asking for user credentials. Just below the credential fields is a \"RECHERCHER UNE CAISSE R\u00c9GIONALE\" button, which translates to \"SEARCH FOR A REGIONAL CASH REGISTER\" in English, which serves as the call-to-action element. It prompts the user to proceed with the action of searching for a regional cash register. My confidence in identifying the brand is high due to the clear visibility of the Credit Agricole logo, but not absolute because there's always a possibility of webpage spoofing or use of the logo in a third-party context (e.g., a service portal for Credit Agricole services created by a different company). There is no evidence of other brands being primary on this page.",
