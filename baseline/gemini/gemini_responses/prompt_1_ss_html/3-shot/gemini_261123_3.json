        "Supporting Evidence": "The webpage displays the company logo \"Dynamic Home Buyers\" prominently at the top of the page. The logo is a stylized representation of a house with the company name incorporated into the design. Below the logo, there is a form with fields for \"Name\", \"Email\", and \"Phone Number\", indicating that the user is required to provide their contact information. The form also includes a \"SUBMIT\" button, which suggests that the user is expected to submit their information to the company. The overall design and layout of the webpage, including the use of the company logo, the contact form, and the \"SUBMIT\" button, strongly suggest that the webpage is associated with Dynamic Home Buyers.",
