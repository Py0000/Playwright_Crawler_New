        "List of Call-To-Actions": "NA",
        "Confidence Score": "9.5",
        "Supporting Evidence": "The webpage has the Spectrum logo at the top left corner, which is a well-known trademark of Charter Communications, a major telecommunications company. The page also has a sign-in form with fields for \"Username\" and \"Password,\" indicating that the page is designed for users to enter their login credentials. However, there is no clear call-to-action button or link on the page. The confidence score is given as 9.5 due to the clear visual representation of the Spectrum brand through the logo and the typical login fields associated with many of its login pages.",
