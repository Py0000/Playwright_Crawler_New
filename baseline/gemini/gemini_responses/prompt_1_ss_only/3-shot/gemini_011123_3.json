        "Supporting Evidence": "The screenshot displays the PUBG Mobile logo prominently at the top, which is the main factor in identifying the brand. This logo is a well-known trademark of PUBG Mobile, a popular battle royale game. The background image is also related to the game's theme. There are two buttons, \"\u0417\u0430\u0440\u0435\u0433\u0438\u0441\u0442\u0440\u0438\u0440\u043e\u0432\u0430\u0442\u044c\u0441\u044f\" (Register) and \"\u0412\u043e\u0439\u0442\u0438\" (Login), which are typical call-to-action elements found on login pages. However, there are no visible fields asking for user credentials, suggesting that this may be a promotional page rather than a login page. The presence of the \"\u00a9 2020 PUBG Arena\" and \"Privacy\", \"Terms of Service\", \"User Agreement\", \"VISA\", and \"Mastercard\" logos at the bottom further support the brand identification.",
