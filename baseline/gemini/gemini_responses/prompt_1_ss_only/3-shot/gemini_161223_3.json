        "Supporting Evidence": "The screenshot displays the Telstra logo prominently at the top, which is the main factor in identifying the brand. This logo is a well-known trademark of Telstra, a large telecommunications company in Australia. Under the logo, there is a sign-in form with fields for \"Telstra email\" and \"Password,\" indicating that the webpage is asking for user credentials. Just below the credential fields is a \"NEXT\" button, which serves as the call-to-action element. It prompts the user to proceed with the action of signing into their account. My confidence in identifying the brand is high due to the clear visibility of the Telstra logo and the typical login fields associated with many of its login pages. The presence of the 'weebly.' at the bottom suggests that the webpage may have been created using the Weebly website-building platform, which does not necessarily affect the identification of the primary brand represented in the screenshot. The design of the sign-in form is straightforward, with no additional elements that might suggest a different brand or service.",
