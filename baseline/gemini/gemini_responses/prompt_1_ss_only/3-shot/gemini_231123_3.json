The presence of the \"Sonraki Ad\u0131m\" button, which translates to \"Next Step\", functions as a call-to-action for users to submit their credentials and proceed to the next step of the login process. The confidence score is given as 8.5 due to the clear visual representation of the PUBG Mobile brand through the logo and the typical login fields associated with many of its login pages. However, the presence of the \"Blog\" link in the top-right corner and the \"Create Blog\" button in the top-right corner introduce a slight uncertainty because these elements are not typically associated with PUBG Mobile's official login pages, which might indicate this is a third-party webpage using PUBG Mobile's login for authentication purposes or a custom PUBG Mobile page created with a website builder.",

This implies that the webpage is asking for user credentials. Just below the credential fields is a \"Next\" button, which serves as the call-to-action element. It prompts the user to proceed with the action of verifying their identity and accessing the secure file. My confidence in identifying the brand is high due to the clear visibility of the Microsoft logo and the presence of the \"Next\" button, which is consistent with Microsoft's design language. There is no evidence of other brands being primary on this page.",
