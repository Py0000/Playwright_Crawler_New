The banner also includes the company's slogan, \"Qualidade em suplementos alimentares.\" Below the banner, there is a search bar and a navigation menu, which includes links to various product categories and pages on the website. The main body of the page is occupied by product listings, which are organized into different categories. Each product listing includes a product image, a product name, a price, and a \"Comprar\" button. The \"Comprar\" button is the primary call-to-action on the page, and it allows users to add products to their shopping cart.
