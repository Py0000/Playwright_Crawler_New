My confidence in identifying the brand is high due to the clear visibility of the AT&T logo, but not absolute because there's always a possibility of webpage spoofing or use of the logo in a third-party context (e.g., a service portal for AT&T services created by a different company). There is no evidence of other brands being primary on this page.

        "Supporting Evidence": "The screenshot displays the USPS logo prominently at the top of the page, which is the primary indicator of the brand. The logo is widely recognized as the symbol for the United States Postal Service. Below the logo, there is a form with fields labeled \"Email\", \"First Name\", \"Last Name\", \"Address Line 1\", \"Address Line 2\", \"City\", \"State\", \"ZIP Code\", \"Phone Number\", and \"SSN (for verification)\". These fields are standard for shipping and address verification processes. The presence of the \"Next\" button indicates that the user is expected to proceed with the form submission. Additionally, the \"Apply Coupon\" button suggests that the user may have the option to apply a coupon code during the checkout process. The overall layout, typography, and design elements of the page are consistent with the USPS branding guidelines. There are no conflicting brands or elements that would suggest any other brand is represented on this page.",
