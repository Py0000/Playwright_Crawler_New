This logo is a well-known trademark of Haberturk, a large Turkish news organization. Below the logo, there is a sign-in form with fields for \"E-posta adresi\" (Email address) and \"\u015eifre\" (Password),\" indicating that the webpage is asking for user credentials. Just below the credential fields is a \"Giri\u015f Yap\" button, which translates to \"Log In\" in English, which serves as the call-to-action element. It prompts the user to proceed with the action of signing into their account. My confidence in identifying the brand is high due to the clear visibility of the Haberturk logo and the typical login fields associated with many of its login pages. However, the presence of the 'H\u00fcrriyet Gazetecilik ve Matbaac\u0131l\u0131k A.\u015e.' at the bottom suggests that the webpage may have been created using the Hurriyet's content management system, which does not necessarily affect the identification of the primary brand represented in the screenshot.
