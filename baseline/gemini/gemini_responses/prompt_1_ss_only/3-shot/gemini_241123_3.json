        "Supporting Evidence": "The screenshot displays the Garena Free Fire logo prominently at the top. The logo is a stylized text that reads \"Free Fire\" with a flame-like design element. Below the logo, there is a Facebook login button with the text \"\u0110\u0103ng nh\u1eadp\" (Vietnamese for \"Login\") and a Vietnamese description above it. Additionally, there is a form with fields for \"H\u1ecd T\u00ean\" (Name), \"Ng\u00e0y Sinh\" (Date of Birth), and \"\u0110\u1ecba Ch\u1ec9\" (Address). These fields indicate that the webpage is asking for user credentials. The presence of the \"\u0110\u0103ng nh\u1eadp\" button, which translates to \"Login\" in English, functions as a call-to-action for users to submit their credentials to access their Free Fire account. The confidence score is given as 8.5 due to the clear visual representation of the Free Fire brand through the logo and the typical login fields associated with many of its login pages. However, the presence of the Facebook login button introduces a slight uncertainty because Facebook is a third-party platform, and its login button is not typically associated with Free Fire's official login pages.",
