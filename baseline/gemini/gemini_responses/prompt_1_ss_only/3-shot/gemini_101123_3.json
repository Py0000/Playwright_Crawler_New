        "Confidence Score": "9.5",
        "Supporting Evidence": "The screenshot displays the Microsoft logo prominently at the top of the page, indicating the brand. The presence of a field labeled \"Enter your email\" and a \"Next\" button suggests that the page is asking for user credentials and has a call-to-action for users to proceed. The overall design and layout of the page are consistent with Microsoft's branding and the OneDrive service. The confidence score is given as 9.5 due to the clear visual representation of the Microsoft brand and the typical login fields associated with many of its login pages.",

        "Supporting Evidence": "The screenshot displays the Facebook logo prominently at the top, which is the main factor in identifying the brand. This logo is a well-known trademark of Facebook, a large social media company. Under the logo, there is a sign-in form with fields for \"Numer telefonu kom\u00f3rkowego lub adres\" (Phone number or email) and \"Has\u0142o\" (Password),\" indicating that the webpage is asking for user credentials. Just below the credential fields is a \"Zaloguj si\u0119\" button, which translates to \"LOG IN\" in English, which serves as the call-to-action element. It prompts the user to proceed with the action of signing into their account. My confidence in identifying the brand is high due to the clear visibility of the Facebook logo, but not absolute because there's always a possibility of webpage spoofing or use of the logo in a third-party context (e.g., a service portal for Facebook services created by a different company). There is no evidence of other brands being primary on this page.",
