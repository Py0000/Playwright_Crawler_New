The presence of the \"Zaloguj si\u0119\" button, which translates to \"LOG IN\" in English, functions as a call-to-action for users to submit their credentials to access their Facebook account. The confidence score is given as 9.0 due to the clear visual representation of the Facebook brand through the logo and the typical login fields associated with many of its login pages. However, the presence of \"POWERED BY weebly\" at the bottom introduces a slight uncertainty because Weebly is a website creation platform and not typically associated with Facebook's official login pages, which might indicate this is a third-party webpage using Facebook's login for authentication purposes or a custom Facebook page created with Weebly.",
