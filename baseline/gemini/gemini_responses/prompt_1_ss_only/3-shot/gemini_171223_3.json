This logo is a well-known trademark of Swisscom, a large telecommunications company.

Just below the credential fields is a \"Continuer\" button, which serves as the call-to-action element. It prompts the user to proceed with the action of signing into their account. My confidence in identifying the brand is high due to the clear visibility of the Swisscom logo, but not absolute because there's always a possibility of webpage spoofing or use of the logo in a third-party context (e.g., a service portal for Swisscom services created by a different company). There is no evidence of other brands being primary on this page. The presence of the 'weebly.' at the bottom suggests that the webpage may have been created using the Weebly website-building platform, which does not necessarily affect the identification of the primary brand represented in the screenshot. The design of the sign-in form is straightforward, with no additional elements that might suggest a different brand or service.",
