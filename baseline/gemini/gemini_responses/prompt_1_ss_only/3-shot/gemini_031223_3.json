The logo is an image of an Aztec warrior with the text \"Azteca Server\" below it. The logo is placed on top of a background image of an Aztec pyramid. The webpage has a dark theme with a gradient from orange to black. The webpage has a simple layout with a single input field for the email address and a button to initiate the login process. The presence of the \"Iniciar Sesi\u00f3n\" button, which translates to \"Start Session\" in English, functions as a call-to-action for users to submit their credentials to access their Azteca Server account. The confidence score is given as 8.5 due to the clear visual representation of the Azteca Server brand through the logo and the typical login fields associated with many of its login pages.",
