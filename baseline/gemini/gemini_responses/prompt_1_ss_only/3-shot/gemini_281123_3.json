This logo is a well-known trademark of Hankook Tech, a large industrial machinery company. Under the logo, there is a sign-in form with fields for \"\uc0ac\uc6a9\uc790\" (Username) and \"\uc554\ud638\" (Password),\" indicating that the webpage is asking for user credentials. Just below the credential fields is a \"\ub85c\uadf8\uc778\" button, which translates to \"LOG IN\" in English, which serves as the call-to-action element. It prompts the user to proceed with the action of signing into their account. My confidence in identifying the brand is high due to the clear visibility of the Hankook Tech logo, but not absolute because there's always a possibility of webpage spoofing or use of the logo in a third-party context (e.g., a service portal for Hankook Tech services created by a different company). There is no evidence of other brands being primary on this page.",
