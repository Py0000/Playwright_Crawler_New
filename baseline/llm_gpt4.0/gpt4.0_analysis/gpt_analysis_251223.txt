1. Target Brand:
The target brand is iCloud, which is Apple's cloud storage and cloud computing service.
2. Has user credential fields:
Yes.
3. Phishing Indicators:
- The URL provided does not match the official Apple iCloud domain. Instead of a simple, recognizable domain associated with legitimate Apple services, the URL has an unusual and complex syntax, with multiple query parameters and nonsensical path segments.
- The domain name itself, "idevicefindmy.info," tries to mimic legitimate Apple-related service names but is not an official domain owned by Apple.
- The excessive use of the word "expire" in the URL path is suspicious and not characteristic of legitimate URLs, which usually aim for clarity and brevity.
- The text after the domain name suggests a string of random characters, which is commonly associated with phishing URLs created to be unique for each potential victim or to bypass security measures.
- The domain uses ".info," a top-level domain (TLD) that is often less regulated and can be associated with malicious websites, whereas Apple's official services would use their own established domains.
- The official iCloud website is known to be "icloud.com," which is distinct from the provided URL.
4. Conclusion:
Phishing.

Note: To validate the conclusion, cross-reference against the legitimate iCloud website should always be performed. The official website of iCloud provided by the user for comparison supports the conclusion that the provided URL is very likely to be a phishing site.

1. Target Brand: The target brand is Netflix, a well-known streaming service.
2. Has user credential fields: The screenshot shows a field for entering an email address but does not show any fields for entering more sensitive information such as passwords or payment details directly. It's possible that the next step after entering the email might ask for such information.
3. Phishing Indicators:
- The domain name in the URL "https://adarshjha12.github.io/netflix-by-adarsh" is suspicious because it is not the official Netflix domain. The usage of a personal GitHub pages domain (GitHub.io) and a specific name ("adarshjha12") indicates that this is not an official Netflix page.
- The inclusion of "netflix-by-adarsh" in the subdirectory is an attempt to make the webpage appear affiliated with Netflix, which can be a deceptive practice.
- The price listed on the page (₹149) could be either outdated or incorrect, which can be a red flag, although it would require further verification.
- The footer of the page lacks several links that are typically found on the official Netflix site.
- There's also a call center number listed at the bottom, which could be another red flag, as reputable companies usually have a different format for their support lines.
4. Conclusion: Phishing

Based on the indicators above, especially the domain name, the webpage appears to be a phishing site attempting to mimic the official Netflix site to collect user information. Users should exercise caution, avoid entering any personal information, and refer directly to the official Netflix website for subscriptions and services.

Unfortunately, I cannot view the webpage screenshot you've mentioned, as you haven't uploaded an image for me to analyze. However, I can analyze the provided URL to help identify potential phishing indicators.
1. Target Brand: Without additional context, it is difficult to ascertain the specific target brand solely from the URL. It may be targeting a financial institution or bank due to the inclusion of words such as "depositpayment," "confirmation," and "bank."
2. Has user credential fields: Cannot be determined without seeing the actual webpage or a screenshot of it.
3. Phishing Indicators:    - The domain "fybeobjects.com" does not correspond with any known reputable financial or banking service, which is suspicious.
   - The long and convoluted URL with a string of numbers, random characters, and terms related to banking/payment resembles common phishing tactics meant to mimic legitimate services.
   - Presence of "bank" in the URL may be an attempt to mislead users into thinking the URL is related to a legitimate banking service.
   - The use of subdomains and file paths in the URL to create a false sense of legitimacy (simulating a more trusted URL structure).
   - Use of "html" at the end which looks like an attempt to mimic a direct file download or official document, typical in phishing scams trying to elicit a sense of urgency or importance.
4. Conclusion: Based on the URL analysis alone, it displays several warning signs that are typical of phishing attempts. Therefore, it seems highly likely the web page is Phishing.

Please note that without seeing the actual page or a screenshot, this conclusion is based solely on the URL structure, which is commonly manipulated in phishing scams.

1. Target Brand:
The target brand is Netflix, a popular streaming service, as indicated by the branding, color scheme, and images used in the screenshot.
2. Has user credential fields:
Yes, there is a field for entering an "Email Address" with a "Get Started" button, which could potentially be used for harvesting user credentials.
3. Phishing Indicators:
- URL: The URL provided `https://prajwalk-07.github.io/netflix-clone.github.io/` and the visited URL indicate that the site is hosted on GitHub Pages under a user account (`prajwalk-07`), which is not an official Netflix domain. Official Netflix URLs typically end with 'netflix.com'.
- Clone Reference: The word 'clone' in the URL suggests that the website is a copy or imitation of the actual Netflix service.
- GitHub Pages: The hosting service GitHub Pages is often used for personal projects or for hosting static pages, which is not characteristic of a large corporation like Netflix which would use its proprietary domain.
- Unfamiliar Contact Number: The contact number provided at the bottom of the page may differ from the official Netflix customer service numbers, which can be a red flag (although this requires verification).
4. Conclusion:
Phishing. Based on the URL that is clearly not an official Netflix domain and other phishing indicators, the webpage is likely an attempt to mimic the official Netflix site for the purpose of phishing or collecting user data without authorization. Users should be cautious and refrain from entering personal information on this site.

1. Target Brand: The target brand appears to be "TFBank," which is presumably a financial institution based on the use of "Bank" in the name.
2. Has user credential fields: Yes, the webpage has fields for entering a "Kundennummer" (customer number) and a birth date.
3. Phishing Indicators:
   - The URL provided "https://bqq.quo.temporary.site/tf" and the visited URL "https://bqq.quo.temporary.site/tf/web/login.php" do not appear to correspond to an official domain for a legitimate financial institution. Authentic bank websites usually have a domain that is straightforward and directly associated with the bank’s name.
   - The use of a ".temporary.site" domain is unusual for a bank and indicates it is not a permanent, official site.
   - The subdomain "bqq.quo" is suspicious, as it does not relate to the "TFBank" name and could be a random or obfuscated string meant to confuse users.
   - The structured page element prompting for the user's Kundennummer and birth date is a common tactic used in phishing to collect personal data. Legitimate bank login pages typically ask for a username or an account number specifically tied to login procedures, not just any customer number or birth date.
   - The visual design of the login box, while professional, is not enough to assure the legitimacy of the site.
4. Conclusion: Phishing

The combination of the suspicious URL, unusual domain structure, and the request for personal information are strong indicators that this is a phishing website designed to impersonate an official "TFBank" website to fraudulently collect user credentials.

1. Target Brand:
The target brand is DHL, a widely recognized international courier, parcel, and express mail service.
2. Has user credential fields:
Yes
3. Phishing Indicators:
- The URL provided (http://gqs.yqp.mybluehost.me/fthjx/des) does not match the official DHL domain and appears to be hosted on a third-party server (mybluehost.me).
- The URL contains a string of seemingly random characters, which is common in phishing attempts to obscure the destination.
- The message prompting for payment to complete the delivery is atypical for courier services, which usually handle payments through more official and traceable channels.
- The fee amount is oddly specific (2.99) and is soliciting to be paid online via an unverified process.
- The urgency expressed in the message to confirm payment "as soon as possible" and within the next 14 days creates a sense of pressure to act quickly, a common tactic used by phishing scams.
- Phishing websites often contain an 'important message' or 'alert' that creates a sense of urgency to prompt the user to input information.
4. Conclusion:
Phishing

Based on the given indicators, the webpage is highly indicative of a phishing attempt aiming to impersonate DHL with the likely intention of soliciting money or sensitive information from the user.

1. Target Brand: Allegro
2. Has user credential fields: No (the provided screenshot does not show any user credential fields)
3. Phishing Indicators:
   - Suspicious URL: The domain name in the URL "zakuppayu24.pl" does not match the official domain for Allegro, which should end with "allegro.pl".
   - Trustworthiness of the seller: The seller's feedback score of 99.8% is visible, which could lend an air of legitimacy. However, this could be fabricated in a phishing attempt.
   - Pricing: The price for an iPhone 14 Pro 256GB seems unusually low, which could be a tactic to entice unsuspecting victims.
   - The URL contains a query parameter "id" with a numeric value, which might resemble a genuine e-commerce URL, but by itself is not a reliable indicator.
   - Lack of secured connection: While the screenshot does not show the full browser address bar, if the site lacks HTTPS it would be a strong indicator of a phishing site.
4. Conclusion: Phishing

Please note, while the indicators suggest this could be a phishing attempt, without clicking the link and conducting a full examination, this is a preliminary assessment based on the given information. Always exercise caution and verify through official channels when in doubt.

To determine whether the provided webpage screenshot and URL are indicative of a phishing site, let's analyze the available information:
1. Target Brand: Monte dei Paschi di Siena (MPS)
2. Has user credential fields: Not visible in the screenshot provided. User credential fields would typically be found on a login page or a page requesting personal information, which this screenshot does not show.
3. Phishing Indicators:
   - URL Inspection: The URL provided "https://www.bancadivenezia.it/persone/digital-banking/index.html" suggests that the domain belongs to "bancadivenezia.it," which raises a red flag, as the official domain of Monte dei Paschi di Siena should be something like "mpsbank.it" or "montepaschi.it." This discrepancy can be an indicator of phishing, where a similar sounding or related domain is used to deceive victims.
   - Visual Inspection of Webpage: The design and quality of the webpage appear to be professional, with no obvious grammatical errors or low-resolution images that are common in phishing attempts. It uses the bank's official logo and adheres to what appears to be an official color scheme and layout style.
   - Trust Seals and Footer Information: The site displays various trust seals and includes footer information such as "Informazioni Legali," "Dati Societari/Informativa Privacy," and "AML-CFT Sicurezza," which are typically found on legitimate banking websites. These elements lend a sense of legitimacy, but careful inspection is required as they can be easily copied by phishers.
   - HTTPS Protocol: It seems to be present, which is a basic security feature, but not a definitive sign of a legitimate site, as many phishing sites now also use HTTPS.
4. Conclusion: The determination of phishing or non-phishing cannot be made with absolute certainty based solely on the information provided. The use of a domain that does not match the official Monte dei Paschi di Siena domain is suspicious and could indicate a phishing attempt. However, without additional information such as an incorrect HTTPS certificate, evidence of data input fields for capturing user information, or other definitive red flags, it is difficult to conclusively label the site as phishing.

Please note that further investigation is required to make a definitive conclusion, including checking the domain registration details, SSL certificate validity, and searching for additional reports or warnings about this website from reputable sources. Users are advised to exercise caution and verify the site through official channels before providing any personal information.

1. Target Brand:
   The target brand appears to be DPD, which is an international parcel delivery service.
2. Has user credential fields:
   The screenshot does not display any user credential fields. However, the nature of phishing websites often includes prompts for user credentials after interacting with the site, such as clicking on a button to plan a new delivery.
3. Phishing Indicators:
   - The URL provided (http://www.neu.planen.lieferung.id.51-107-1-90.cprapid.com/info/paket/update.php) has several red flags. The domain structure is complex and suspicious, using multiple subdomains and an IP address (51-107-1-90) within the URL, which is an atypical format for legitimate business URLs.
   - The subdomain "neu.planen.lieferung" seems crafted to mimic a legitimate service but does not match the official DPD domain structure.
   - The use of an IP address in the subdomain makes it seem as though the site is trying to hide its actual domain, which is a common phishing tactic.
   - The domain "cprapid.com" is not associated with the official DPD website.
   - The provided URL contains ".com" while many legitimate DPD websites use country-specific domains, such as ".de" for Germany.
   - The path "/info/paket/update.php" might be designed to sound official but could potentially lead to a page designed to steal information.
   - There is a lack of secure HTTPS protocol in the URL, which is unusual for a legitimate service dealing with personal information.
   - The screenshot's content suggests an issue with parcel delivery and prompts the user to take action, which can create a sense of urgency, often used by phishing schemes to entice users to provide sensitive information quickly.
4. Conclusion:
   Phishing
   
Given the URL's suspicious elements and how they are commonly associated with phishing attempts, the conclusion is that the webpage is most likely a phishing site targeting DPD customers. It would be advisable for users to avoid interacting with this site and instead make contact through the official DPD website or customer service channels.

1. Target Brand: Microsoft
2. Has user credential fields: No (The screenshot provided does not show any user credential fields, such as login or password inputs. However, the presence of such fields could be on other parts of the website that are not visible in the screenshot.)
3. Phishing Indicators:    - The URL provided is suspect and does not match the visited URL or Microsoft's official domain structure ("http://cloudflare-ipfs.com/ipfs/...").
   - The use of a third-party service (IPFS via Cloudflare) which is not a typical method for legitimate Microsoft webpages.
   - The discrepancy between the provided URL and the visited URL suggests a potential phishing attempt, as the content might still be pulling from a malicious source while showing a legitimate front.
4. Conclusion: Phishing (Based on the provided URL which does not conform with Microsoft's official domain, and the use of a potentially deceptive method to display content.)


bbff5f79af2f06e519617dc40816880a53e3023ba8945eee669e0f2ac18b40c8
The image you provided does not contain a screenshot of a webpage, but it appears to be a screenshot of a messaging application interface. Therefore, based on the image alone, I cannot properly evaluate a URL to determine if it's a phishing site. However, I can analyze the URL you provided: "http://ovjaoo.c505.net/."

Here’s a hypothetical analysis based on the URL information:
1. Target Brand: Undeterminable from the URL alone without webpage content.
2. Has user credential fields: Cannot be determined without access to the actual webpage content.
3. Phishing Indicators:
   - The URL uses an unfamiliar domain name which seems unrelated to any legitimate, well-known website or brand.
   - The website uses HTTP instead of secured HTTPS, which could be seen as suspicious for sites requiring sensitive personal information.
   - The subdomain and the general structure of the URL appear unconventional, which might suggest it's not an official site of a known brand.
4. Conclusion: Due to the lack of supporting webpage content, we cannot confirm whether the webpage is phishing or non-phishing based solely on the URL. A direct investigation of the webpage content would be necessary for a complete assessment.

To properly determine if it's a phishing site, an analysis of the webpage content, including any forms or requests for personal information, would be required. If you have a screenshot of the webpage or can describe its content, I could provide a more thorough evaluation.

1. Target Brand: Bet365
2. Has user credential fields: Yes (While the screenshot does not explicitly display the credential fields, there's an implication that such fields may exist given the nature of the site as a login would typically be required)
3. Phishing Indicators:
   - The URL contains numbers (793e365) which is a common tactic used by phishing sites to mimic legitimate websites but with slight variations.
   - The domain does not have a secured connection (https), which is unusual for a legitimate betting site.
   - The visual design and layout appear cluttered with numerous promotional banners, which can be a sign of a lower-quality or illegitimate site.
   - The screenshot shows a pop-up with promotional offers, which can be used to lure users into providing information or making a transaction.
   - The top-level domain (.com) in the logo doesn't match the actual URL domain that has been visited (.com is expected for the official Bet365).
   
4. Conclusion: Phishing

While there is no direct evidence in the image to definitively categorize it as phishing, the use of a similar yet altered domain name and the factors listed above would suggest this site may be a phishing attempt designed to mimic Bet365. Users should exercise extreme caution and verify the authenticity of the site through the official Bet365 channels before providing any information.


ca6d311b1afa405474829838ae0f9d7055259fe51e6e7e8ba67376e414f4f0b9
Based on the provided screenshot and URLs, here's the analysis:
1. Target Brand: Not explicitly identifiable from the provided information.
2. Has user credential fields: No user credential fields are visible in the screenshot provided.
3. Phishing Indicators:
   - Misalignment/Inconsistencies: The visible URL "https://plum19588527.brizy.site/" does not seem to have any logical connection to the content of the screenshot, hinting at a possible lack of authenticity.
   - Quality of Content: A detailed inspection of the content quality for grammatical errors, style, and branding inconsistencies would be necessary; however, nothing immediately stands out from the given image.
   - Absence of Secure Connection Indicators: The "https" prefix is present, which usually indicates a secure connection, but by itself, it is not a guarantee of legitimacy.
   - Domain Name Suspiciousness: The domain "brizy.site" may not correlate with any known, reputable brand involved in organizing cultural contests. This can be suspicious, as official contests are likely to be hosted on more recognizable, brand-consistent domains.
   - Context of Links: Other clues would come from examining where the links on the page lead to, but this cannot be done from the image alone.
   - Trust Badges: The "Made With Brizy" badge indicates a website builder, which isn't inherently a phishing indicator, but phishing websites can also be created using legitimate website builders.
4. Conclusion: With the limited information available from the screenshot and the absence of visible credential fields or explicit target brand identification, it is not possible to conclusively classify the webpage as a phishing site. Additional investigation, such as analyzing the behavior of the website upon interaction (e.g., what happens when a user attempts to vote), checking the associated domain registration details, and looking for reports of fraudulent activity connected to the visible URLs, would be required to reach a definitive conclusion.

1. Target Brand:
The target brand appears to be DPD, which is a well-known international parcel delivery service.
2. Has user credential fields:
The displayed portion of the webpage does not show any user credential fields directly. However, as this is a common tactic in phishing, there could be user credential fields either on other parts of the webpage or after clicking on the provided call-to-action buttons.
3. Phishing Indicators:
- The URL provided (https://18-197-40-90.cprapid.com/cz/) and the visited URL (https://18-197-40-90.cprapid.com/cz/update.php) are significant indicators of phishing. These URLs indicate that the host is an IP address (18.197.40.90) followed by a domain name (cprapid.com) that does not match the legitimate domain of DPD.
- The URL being an IP address is not typical for legitimate business use, especially for customer-facing pages, as it's less user-friendly and less professional than a branded domain.
- The subdomain (cprapid.com) is not associated with the official DPD domain and raises suspicion.
- The legitimate DPD would use their own secured and verified domain for all communication, not an unrelated one.
- There is a possibility of a malicious redirection or attempt to mimic an official webpage through the use of DPD branding within the page.
- The page is alerting about a package delivery issue and prompting action, which is a common scare tactic used in phishing attacks to get the recipient to act quickly without scrutinizing the authenticity of the message.
4. Conclusion:
Phishing.

This webpage shows clear signs of being a phishing attempt. The URL's domain is not associated with the official DPD website, and the use of an IP address is unusual for legitimate corporate communication. Recipients of such messages should verify the authenticity by directly contacting the official customer service channels provided by DPD and should never input personal information into unverified webpages.


e5448eaf6dfd65cbf0bb437afebece09e1266f1fe519a8ff68157427d91bcda5
1. Target Brand: DHL
2. Has user credential fields: Yes (Fields for E-post [Email] and Lösenord [Password])
3. Phishing Indicators:    - To assess whether the page is a phishing site, I would need to check multiple factors, such as:
     - The URL provided "https://my.dhlparcel.se/account/sign-in" should match the legitimate domain for DHL services, especially the domain suffix "se" if it's intended for Swedish users, as the page content is in Swedish.
     - The visual design and user interface should be consistent with DHL's branding and professional standards.
     - Presence of SSL certificate (https://) and domain verification.
     - The language and grammar should align with what's expected from an official communications by DHL.
     - Look for any suspicious or unusual request for information or functionality.
     - Considering cookies and privacy policy statements typical for legitimate sites.
   - Based on the screenshot alone I cannot thoroughly verify the SSL certificate, who owns the domain, nor fully assess the page content for subtle errors that might be indicative of a phishing attempt.
4. Conclusion: Insufficient information to conclusively determine if the page is phishing or non-phishing. A more detailed analysis, including an investigation of the SSL certificate, domain registration, more webpage content, and possibly the behavior of the website upon interacting with the user credential fields would be required.
