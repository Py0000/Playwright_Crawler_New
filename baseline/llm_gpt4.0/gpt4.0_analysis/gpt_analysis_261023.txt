1. Target Brand: Société Générale
2. Has user credential fields: Yes
3. Phishing Indicators:
   - The URL provided ("http://ravertueoiu.blogsite.org/") does not correspond to the official domain of Société Générale, which should typically end in societegenerale.com or a variation of the official bank's domain.
   - The visited URL ("https://custeur.dnsalias.net/oiuiyutfio/SG%2020/") also suggests an unofficial domain and includes elements that are suspicious such as "dnsalias.net" and additional subdirectories that do not seem legitimate for a banking website.
   - The use of a free blog site or a DNS alias service in the URLs does not align with the security protocols and domain management practices of legitimate financial institutions.
   - The page design in the screenshot mimics the official Société Générale login page, but without knowing the precise original source URL it's shown at, the graphics alone are not sufficient to validate its authenticity.
4. Conclusion: Phishing 

The inconsistency between the brand's established web presence and the URLs provided is a strong indicator of a phishing attempt. Users should be cautious and always verify that they are using the official banking website URL when entering sensitive information.

1. Target Brand: Correos (Spanish postal service)
2. Has user credential fields: No user credential fields are visible in the screenshot provided.
3. Phishing Indicators:
   - URL Mismatch: The provided URL 'http://kivaya.com' and the additional long URL with uncommon query parameters do not match the official domain of the 'Correos' postal service.
   - Suspicious URL Structure: The complexity and randomness of the URL path and query parameters ('ESV5612/index.php?FGDD=1#HDHKJDJDSSJDSJKJDSJDSDJJDSHYKJHGFG') appear unusual and likely to be a phishing attempt to mimic a legitimate tracking function.
   - Lack of HTTPS: The URL provided uses 'http' instead of 'https', meaning it is not secure, which is a common security feature on legitimate sites, especially for those dealing with user data.
   - Generic Top-Level Domain (TLD): The TLD '.com' in the URL may raise suspicion since large entities and especially governmental or official services in a specific country (like 'Correos') often have country-code TLDs, such as '.es' for Spain.
4. Conclusion: Phishing

The mismatch between the URL and the known domain of the target brand, as well as the other phishing indicators, suggest that this is a phishing attempt aimed at users of the Correos postal service.

1. Target Brand:
The target brand being imitated here is Microsoft Outlook, which is Microsoft's email service.
2. Has user credential fields:
Yes, there is a field for users to input their email, phone, or Skype, suggesting it is prompting for user credentials.
3. Phishing Indicators:
- The URL provided "https://worudi.com/office.com/" does not match the legitimate domain of Microsoft Outlook or any other Microsoft service, which should typically be under the domain "outlook.com" or "office.com", preceded by "https://" and often includes "microsoft" within the URL structure.
- Presence of a deceptive subdomain: The legitimate Microsoft login page would not use a non-Microsoft domain with "/office.com/" path. This is a common trick to make the URL appear legitimate at a quick glance.
- When analyzing the URL, "worudi.com" is the actual domain, and "office.com" is simply a subdirectory, which is not how Microsoft structures its URLs.
- If "Visited URL" is also taken into account, and if it is the same as the "Provided URL", it indicates that the same misleading structure is being used.
- Lack of HTTPS protocol in the Provided URL (if it’s the one used for the website in the screenshot) and Visited URL could also be considered as an indicator. However, in this case, the screenshot shows "Terms of use" and "Privacy statement" links at the bottom, indicating the presence of HTTPS on the actual page. Since the URL began with "https://" it can be assumed secure, but the domain is still suspicious.
4. Conclusion:
Phishing. The webpage in the screenshot is designed to look like the Microsoft Outlook sign-in page, but the URL provided and visited is not a legitimate Microsoft domain and has clear signs of being a phishing attempt to trick users into providing their credentials.

1. Target Brand
The target brand appears to be Facebook, as indicated by the Facebook logo in the upper left corner of the screenshot.
2. Has user credential fields
The provided image does not show any user credential fields directly, but it suggests that such fields may be present after clicking the "Join Group" link.
3. Phishing Indicators
- Extremely high-profit promises: The offer claims participants can earn "$10,000-$30,000+ Profit Every Day," which is an unrealistic and suspicious claim.
- Urgency and scarcity: The use of phrases like "Only 100 free spots, so act now!!!" is a common tactic to pressure users into taking immediate action without due consideration.
- URL credibility: The URL "https://tjcks66.xyz/" does not seem to match any known legitimate or official domain associated with Facebook or any reputable financial or trading institutions.
- Quality of visuals and language: There are noticeable inconsistencies in design quality, typography, and a mixture of character styles (like quotation marks) that seem unprofessional.
- Unverified claims: Endorsements and logos of well-known brands like Binance US, Coinbase, eToro, Robinhood, and dYdX are used without evidence of actual affiliation or partnership.
- Spelling and grammar errors: The text contains grammatical errors, such as "you you're new to crypto" instead of "you're new to crypto."
- Disclaimers and trademarks: At the bottom, it states "This site is not a part of the YouTube, Google or Facebook website; Google Inc or Facebook Inc.". These disclaimers are often used to avoid legal issues, but in this context, they can signal an attempt to distance from official entities while misusing their logos.
- Testimonials: The use of testimonials in such adverts is a common technique to build unwarranted trust; these testimonials are likely fabricated as they do not provide verifiable information or sources.
4. Conclusion
Phishing

Given the listed indicators, the webpage in question exhibits numerous characteristics common to phishing attempts, and a cautious approach would be to consider it a potential phishing site. Users should avoid interacting with such sites and never provide personal, financial, or login information.

1. Target Brand: The brand appears to be "12 Volt Does IT," which is presented as a provider of automotive electronic services and products.
2. Has user credential fields: No user credential fields (such as login or password inputs) are visible in the provided screenshot.
3. Phishing Indicators:
   - The URL provided does not have a secure connection (http instead of https). However, upon visiting the URL, it was found to redirect to a secure connection (https), which might mitigate this worry.
   - The design of the website could be considered slightly unprofessional due to various font sizes and styles, which can sometimes be a sign of a phishing website; however, this is inconclusive without further context.
   - The claims of free services and products might be an enticement strategy often used by phishing sites, but legitimate promotions can also use this tactic.
   - The presence of prices and the variety of products could indicate a functioning e-commerce website, which tends to suggest a non-phishing intention.
   - There is a lack of comprehensive contact information; while an email address and location are provided, the absence of a phone number could be seen as suspicious but not definitive.
   - No explicit typos or grammatical errors are visible in the screenshot.
4. Conclusion: Non-phishing. Based on the provided screenshot and the analysis of the webpage elements, there are no definitive indicators that this website is a phishing website. The site seems to present an e-commerce platform offering products and services related to vehicle electronics. Furthermore, the webpage URL does redirect to a secure connection, which is a good practice for legitimate business websites.  Without more explicit indicators of phishing or deceptive practices, the conclusion from the given data is that the website does not appear to be a phishing site. However, always exercise caution and conduct a more detailed review or use website verification tools for any online transactions to ensure the website's authenticity.

1. Target Brand: Microsoft 365
2. Has user credential fields: No (There are no visible user credential fields in the provided screenshot.)
3. Phishing Indicators:
   - URL Suspicion: The provided URL contains "officesoftcn.com" which does not match the official Microsoft domain and seems to impersonate an official Microsoft website.
   - Visual Design: The webpage closely imitates the style and branding of Microsoft, potentially to deceive users into believing it is legitimate.
   - Discounted Prices: The products are listed with prices that may be considered unusually low for genuine Microsoft products, which could be a tactic to lure unsuspecting victims.
   - Domain Registration Information: The registration information for the domain could potentially reveal inconsistencies or recent creation dates often associated with phishing sites (requires further investigation to confirm).
   - Trust Seals: The absence of trust seals from recognized internet security organizations, which are usually present on legitimate e-commerce sites.
   - Language and Grammar: There may be subtle language or grammar issues that can indicate a phishing attempt (requires closer text examination to confirm).
   - Contact Information: There may be missing or suspicious contact information (requires further inspection to confirm).
4. Conclusion: Phishing

The conclusion is based on the suspicious nature of the URL and visual attempt to mimic an official Microsoft webpage to potentially deceive users into believing they are purchasing legitimate Microsoft products. However, this determination should be verified with additional, more thorough checks, such as investigating the site's domain registration, SSL certificate validity, and searching for user reports or warnings from official sources about the site.

1. Target Brand: PUBG Mobile
2. Has user credential fields: No (There are no visible fields for entering user credentials in the provided screenshot)
3. Phishing Indicators:
   - The URL provided (http://she2we.privrendom.com/) does not match the official PUBG Mobile or associated legitimate game services.
   - The domain name "privrendom.com" appears suspicious and does not resemble the official domain for PUBG Mobile, which would typically be associated with "PUBG" or "Tencent Games" in some manner.
   - The webpage design, while imitating the style of PUBG Mobile, can be part of a phishing scheme to convince users it is legitimate.
   - There is no secure connection indicator (https://) in the URL, which is usually expected of legitimate gaming or transactional services.
4. Conclusion: Phishing

Based on these indicators, it is highly likely that the website is a phishing site designed to mimic the official PUBG Mobile site to deceive users.

1. Target Brand: Google (Gmail/Google Drive login page is mimicked).
2. Has user credential fields: Yes (Username and Password fields are present).
3. (List of) Phishing Indicators:
   - The URL provided (http://cynosure-modelling.cloud/) does not match the official Google URL domain.
   - The webpage's URL visited (http://cynosure-modelling.cloud/login.html) is not secured with HTTPS, which is unusual for legitimate Google services that require login credentials.
   - The quality of the Google logo may not be as high as expected on official pages. The sharpness and resolution can indicate a copied or altered image.
   - The overall design, while similar to a Google login page, may have discrepancies in layout, font, or styling when closely examined against the authentic Google login pages.
   - Legitimate Google pages typically do not ask you to log in to "Continue to Drive" through a separate pop-up-like page; they usually have a fluid and integrated sign-in process.
   - A misspelling or grammatical error in the page text. Real Google websites are typically free from such errors; however, the screenshot does not provide clear evidence of this.
   - The page footer only has "Google", "Privacy & Terms", and "Help", when an authentic Google sign-in page often includes more detailed footer links.
   
4. Conclusion: Phishing

This webpage shows classic signs of a phishing attempt by trying to mimic a Google login page to deceive users into entering their credentials.

1. Target Brand
The screenshot provided does not include any explicit branding elements such as a logo or a company name that can be used to accurately determine the target brand. However, given that the interface resembles that of messaging or social networking apps, it may be targeting brands that provide similar services.
2. Has user credential fields
The screenshot does not show any user credential fields such as username or password entry points. Still, it is important to note that phishing sites often have such fields on other pages not visible in the screenshot provided.
3. Phishing Indicators
   - Unusual URL: The subdomain and domain combination ("gruop-wadtudjjw.terbaru-2023.com") appears unusual and does not resemble a legitimate or familiar service provider's URL.
   - The URL contains a lot of random characters which do not seem to represent a legitimate service or company name ("wadtudjjw", "vhsfhqpdhdsih6").
   - Use of a top-level domain (".com") alongside a domain that suggests temporality or trendiness ("terbaru-2023"), which is a common tactic to create a sense of urgency or relevancy.
   - The screenshot itself contains elements that raise concern, such as a group name that may allude to inappropriate content ("GRUP BOKEP") which might be used to lure users into joining under false pretenses.
4. Conclusion
Given the abnormal URL structure that does not correspond to a known brand and the lack of brand identification in the provided image, the webpage should be approached with caution. Without more information on what occurs when navigating further or what this page is linked to, it's challenging to definitively conclude that it is a phishing site. However, the indicators suggest that it is potentially dangerous and could be designed to trick users into providing personal information or joining under false pretenses. Thus, it should be treated as suspicious and potentially a phishing attempt.

1. Target Brand: Apple
2. Has user credential fields: Yes
3. Phishing Indicators:
   - URL Mismatch: The provided URL "https://skstore.top/" is suspicious as it does not match the official Apple domain which typically includes "apple.com."
   - Language Discrepancy: The screenshot shows a mix of languages (Korean and English), which might not be consistent with the official localized versions of Apple's website.
   - Design and Layout: While the page has been designed to mimic the Apple ID login page, there may be subtle differences in layout, fonts, or graphical elements that could indicate it is not an official page.
   - Domain Age: Phishing domains are often newly created; the credibility of "skstore.top" as a domain can be additionally checked for its registration date and history.
   - Contact Information: Phishing websites may display suspicious or non-existent contact information. The footer information may not match that of the official Apple website.
4. Conclusion: Phishing

Given the URL discrepancy as the primary indicator along with other contextual clues from the screenshot, it is highly likely to be a phishing site.

1. Target Brand: Telegram
2. Has user credential fields: Based on the provided screenshot, there are no visible user credential fields.
3. Phishing Indicators:
   - The URL is suspicious because it has a domain that deviates from the official Telegram URL. The legitimate domain for Telegram is `telegram.org`, not `telegramm.cloud`.
   - The use of an additional 'm' in 'telegramm' is a common technique used in phishing to mimic a legitimate site.
   - The subdomain 'TG_ZH' seems unusual and not typical for the official Telegram website.
   - The overall design and presentation may look convincing, but this alone isn't enough to determine the legitimacy of the site without further inspection.
4. Conclusion: Phishing. 

Although there are no visible user credential fields in the provided screenshot, the URL highly suggests that this is a phishing site attempting to mimic the official Telegram website, potentially to mislead users into providing personal information or downloading malicious software.

1. Target Brand: There is no specific brand being targeted in the provided website screenshot. The website appears to present a business named "SHENG HO JIUN" involved in packaging and bottling.
2. Has user credential fields: Based on the provided screenshot, there are no visible user credential fields such as login or password input fields.
3. Phishing Indicators:
   - The presence of HTTPS in both the provided and visited URL is usually a positive sign, but this alone isn't conclusive evidence of a website's legitimacy.
   - The image shows a professional-looking website with product images, company information, certificates, and contact details, which are not common characteristics of a phishing site.
   - No overt indications of phishing such as poor quality images, spelling errors, or suspicious redirects are visible in the screenshot.
   - The contact information provided includes an email address and phone numbers, which appears to add credibility but may need secondary verification.
   - The screenshot indicates that the site is powered by "TC Net" and designed by "THAIV", neither of which contain obvious signs of being associated with phishing but would require further investigation.
4. Conclusion: Non-phishing. Based on the information available from the screenshot, there are no clear signs of phishing. The website seems to depict a legitimate business without obvious phishing indicators. However, a definitive assessment would require a thorough examination of the actual website, checking for secure connections, site certificates, user reviews, business registration details, and additional security checks.

1. Target Brand: Desjardins
2. Has user credential fields: No visible user credential fields in the provided screenshot.
3. Phishing Indicators:    - The URL provided ('https://www.fondsdesjardins.com/fnb/prix-rendements/') corresponds with the expected domain of the real Desjardins Group.
   - The design and branding appear consistent with Desjardins' official marketing and web design standards.
   - The site includes an option to select a user profile (Conseiller, Investisseur) which is a feature on legitimate financial institutions' websites to customize the experience for different types of users.
   - The webpage includes a detailed table of funds with associated symbols, dates, performance metrics, etc., which indicates a level of sophistication and detail in line with a legitimate financial services firm.
   - The screenshot shows a download option for a CSV file, which is a common feature provided by legitimate financial websites for users to download their data.
   - The footer of the website contains links to adviser access, contact information, equity links, and legal information, which is typical for real financial institution websites.
   - The copyright notice at the bottom (“© 1996-2023, Fonds Desjardins. Tous droits réservés”) corresponds with the current date and indicates a long-established presence.
   - There are no overt spelling mistakes, grammatical errors, or low-quality graphics, which are often indicators of phishing attempts.
4. Conclusion: Non-phishing

The absence of immediate phishing indicators and the professional quality of the webpage's design, coupled with a matching URL to the known Desjardins domain and reasonable web content, suggests that this webpage is a legitimate Desjardins Group financial information page and is not a phishing site.

1. Target Brand:
The target brand appears to be Arvest Bank, which is a legitimate financial institution based in the United States.
2. Has user credential fields:
The provided screenshot does not show any explicit user credential fields such as a login form where users can input their username and password. However, there is a section labeled "Online Access" with a play button that could potentially lead to a login page, but it's not directly visible in this screenshot.
3. Phishing Indicators:
- The URL "http://arvestonlineltd.com/" raises suspicion because it deviates from the expected domain of a legitimate bank. Legitimate banks usually have secure, easily verifiable domains.
- Lack of HTTPS: The provided URL begins with "http" rather than "https". Financial institutions typically use HTTPS to secure user data.
- The URL includes the term "ltd" which can be unusual for a direct banking domain.
- The design and quality of the webpage do not match the professional standard typically associated with legitimate banking websites.
- There are potential grammatical issues and a mismatch in branding consistency in the text content.
- The contact email provided at the bottom is not an official Arvest Bank email domain and is a general customer service email, which is unusual for a bank.
- Offers a variety of services that could be aiming to attract a wide range of victims.
- The loan calculation tool seems generic and lacks secure submission indicators.
- The domain "arvestonlineltd.com" is unusual for Arvest Bank, whose official website domain is different.
4. Conclusion:
Considering the indicators of phishing listed, it is advisable to conclude that the webpage is likely a Phishing site. Users should exercise caution and verify the site's legitimacy through official channels before entering any personal information.


f7380292cf7bfb9a47f21a9cd8aa94360efd80ef35315a1aea11ed7241d7373f
From the screenshot provided, I am unable to definitively label the webpage as a phishing site or a legitimate one because phishing determination requires more comprehensive analysis than just visual inspection of a screenshot. However, I can list some common indicators and considerations for such analysis:
1. Target Brand: The website seems to be related to beer or alcoholic beverage sales, but no specific mainstream brand is immediately recognizable or targeted, such as a popular beer brand or retail chain.
2. Has user credential fields: No user credential fields such as login forms, password inputs, or payment details are visible in the provided image.
3. Phishing Indicators:    - The use of HTTPS protocol (as seen in the URL provided https://pivokom.ru/) is a positive sign, as most legitimate websites use this protocol to ensure a secure connection.
   - No obvious spelling or grammar mistakes in the visible text, which would be potential indicators of a phishing site.
   - The website has a clear structure and appears professionally designed, which can be a point against it being a phishing site; however, even phishing sites can sometimes look professional.
4. Conclusion: Based on this image alone, there is an insufficient amount of definitive evidence to conclude that this is a phishing site. 

It is important to conduct a more thorough investigation, such as checking domain registration details, looking for reviews of the domain or website, analyzing the website's behavior in a controlled environment, and scanning the website for malicious code before concluding if it is phishing or not.
