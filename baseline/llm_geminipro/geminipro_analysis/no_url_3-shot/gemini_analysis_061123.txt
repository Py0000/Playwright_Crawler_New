 - Although the design of this webpage closely mimics the design of the official Trust Wallet page when this domain of this webpage is not from the official Trust Wallet domain, which indicates an attempt to deceive the user that it is the real Trust Wallet page without looking at the url.
 - This would trick the user into entering his account credentials, thereby leaking sensitive info to a non-official Trust Wallet page, since there are fields asking for user's credential on this page.
