 1. Prediction: Phishing
2. Target Brand: Microsoft
3. Yes (has user credential fields). Asking for email and password. 
4. Reasons supporting prediction: 
   The domain in the provided url and the final url visited doesn't match the legitimate Microsoft domain.
   Although the page did not directly include elements that ask user to enter their Microsoft account information, but based on the text in the green box as well as the availability of the “start” button, there is a high possibility that the page is hinting the user to hit on the “start” button, which may lead the user to a page that will request the user to enter in his/her account details, inorder for him/her to recover access to his/her Microsoft account.
   Moreover, the design of this webpage closely mimics the design of the official Microsoft page when this domain of this webpage is not from the official Microsoft domain, which indicates an attempt to deceive the user that it is the real Microsoft page without looking at the url.

4. Reasons supporting Prediction: 
   The domain in the provided url and the final url visited doesn't match the legitimate adobe domain.
   The design of this webpage closely mimics the design of the official Adobe Acrobat login page when this domain of this webpage is not from the official Adobe Acrobat domain, which indicates an attempt to deceive the user that it is the real Adobe Acrobat page without looking at the url.
