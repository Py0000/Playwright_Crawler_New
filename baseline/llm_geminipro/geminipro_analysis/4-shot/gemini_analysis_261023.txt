 1. Prediction: Phishing
2. Target Brand: Societe Generale
3. Yes (has user credential fields). Asking for client code and a password. 
4. Reasons supporting Prediction: 
   The URL visited ('ravertueoiu.blogsite.org') does not match the official domain of Societe Generale, which would typically end in 'societegenerale.com' or the corresponding country domain for its local branches (e.g., 'societegenerale.fr' for France).
   The structure of the URL, which includes multiple subdirectories and a reference to 'SG 20/', is atypical for a banking website where security and simplicity are paramount.
   The URL path implies it's a page related to JavaScript files ('/dist/js/pages/'), which is unconventional for a login or credentials verification page on a banking website.
   Despite the webpage looking very official with the correct logos and French language usage, the URL is a significant red flag. Banks typically do not host login pages on unrelated domains.

 1. Prediction: Phishing
2. Target Brand: Google
3. Yes (has user credential fields). Asking for email and password. 
4. Reasons supporting Prediction: 
   The domain in the provided url and the final url visited doesn't match the legitimate Google domain.
   Moreover, the design of this webpage closely mimics the design of the official Google page when this domain of this webpage is not from the official Google domain, which indicates an attempt to deceive the user that it is the real Google page without looking at the url.
   This would trick the user into entering his account credentials, thereby leaking sensitive info to a non-official Google page, since there are fields asking for user's credential on this page.
