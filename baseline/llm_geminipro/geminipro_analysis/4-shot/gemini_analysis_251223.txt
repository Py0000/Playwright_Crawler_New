 1. Prediction: Phishing
2. Target Brand: Allegro
3. Yes (has user credential fields). Asking for email and password. 
4. Reasons supporting Prediction: 
   The URL visited ('zakuppayu24.pl') does not match the official domain of Allegro, which is 'allegro.pl'.
   The URL path implies it's a page related to payments ('zakuppayu24'), which is not a typical subdomain for a product page on Allegro.
   The presence of a green padlock icon and 'https' in the URL bar does not guarantee legitimacy, as phishers can obtain SSL certificates and use them on fraudulent websites.
   The 'allegro.pl' logo and branding elements on the page can be easily copied or imitated by phishers, making it crucial to examine the URL and other indicators.
   The 'Kup Teraz' button typically found on Allegro product pages is replaced with 'Do Koszyka' (Add to Cart), which is not consistent with Allegro's usual terminology.
   The 'allegro.pl' text in the browser tab is different from the actual URL, indicating potential manipulation.
   The overall design and layout of the page deviate slightly from the official Allegro website, which can be a sign of a phishing attempt.

4. Reasons that support prediction

 - The structure of the URL, which includes multiple subdirectories and a reference to 'update.php', is atypical for a tracking page on a logistics company's website.
 - The URL path implies it's a page related to updating information, which is not what a user would expect when tracking a package.
 - The page lacks the usual security indicators, such as a padlock icon in the address bar or a security certificate, which are common on legitimate websites that handle sensitive information.
 - The DPD logo is distorted.
