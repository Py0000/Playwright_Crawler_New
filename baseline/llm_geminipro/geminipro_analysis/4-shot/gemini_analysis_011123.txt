 1. Prediction: Phishing
2. Target Brand: Microsoft
3. Yes (has user credential fields). Asking for email and password. 
4. Reasons supporting Prediction: 
   The domain in the provided url and the final url visited doesn't match the legitimate Microsoft domain.
   The design of this webpage closely mimics the design of the official Microsoft login page when this domain of this webpage is not from the official Microsoft domain, which indicates an attempt to deceive the user that it is the real Microsoft page without looking at the url.
   This would trick the user into entering his account credentials, thereby leaking sensitive info to a non-official Microsoft page, since there are fields asking for user's credential on this page.
