 1. Prediction: Phishing
2. Target Brand: None
3. Yes (has user credential fields). Asking for email and password. 
4. Reasons supporting Prediction: 
   The URL visited ('ip170.ip-51-89-105.eu') does not match the official domain of any known company or brand.
   The URL path implies it's a page related to verification ('verifica.php'), which could be related to account verification or login.
   The presence of a security-related task (recovering password) on a non-reputable domain is suspicious.
   The webpage design looks like a generic template and lacks branding or visual elements that would indicate a legitimate company.
   The page requests the user's email and password, which are sensitive credentials often sought by phishing attempts.

 1. Prediction: Phishing
2. Target Brand: Videotron
3. Yes (has user credential fields). Asking for email and password. 
4. Reasons supporting Prediction: 
   The URL visited ('videotronmaill.weebly.com') does not match the official domain of Videotron, which would typically end in 'videotron.com'.
   The structure of the URL, which includes 'weebly.com', indicates that the website is hosted on a third-party platform, which is not typical for a legitimate Videotron login page.
   The design of the webpage is not consistent with the official Videotron website, and the overall look and feel appears amateurish.
   The presence of a 'connexion' button instead of a 'login' or 'sign in' button is not typical for a legitimate Videotron login page.
   The text on the right side of the login form contains grammatical errors and repetitions, which suggests that it was not written by a native French speaker.

 1. Prediction: Phishing
2. Target Brand: Bank of Ireland
3. Yes (has user credential fields). Asking for User ID, Date of birth, and Phone Number. 
4. Reasons supporting Prediction: 
   The domain in the provided url and the final url visited doesn't match the legitimate Bank of Ireland domain.
   Although the design of this webpage closely mimics the design of the official Bank of Ireland page when this domain of this webpage is not from the official Bank of Ireland domain, which indicates an attempt to deceive the user that it is the real Bank of Ireland page without looking at the url.
   This would trick the user into entering his account credentials, thereby leaking sensitive info to a non-official Bank of Ireland page, since there are fields asking for user's credential on this page.
