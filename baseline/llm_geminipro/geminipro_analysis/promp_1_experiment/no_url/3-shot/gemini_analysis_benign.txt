 1. Target Brand: Netflix
2. Any user credential fields (Yes/No) + list them if any: Yes, Email and Password
3. Prediction: Phishing
4. The domain in the provided url and the final url visited doesn't match the legitimate Netflix domain.
Although the page did not directly include elements that ask user to enter their Netflix account information, but based on the text in the green box as well as the availability of the “start” button, there is a high possibility that the page is hinting the user to hit on the “start” button, which may lead the user to a page that will request the user to enter in his/her account details, inorder for him/her to recover access to his/her Netflix account.
Moreover, the design of this webpage closely mimics the design of the official Netflix page when this domain of this webpage is not from the official Netflix domain, which indicates an attempt to deceive the user that it is the real Netflix page without looking at the url.
