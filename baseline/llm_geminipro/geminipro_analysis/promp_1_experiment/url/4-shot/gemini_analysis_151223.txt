2. Target Brand: Microsoft
3. Yes (has user credential fields). Asking for email and password. 
4. Reasons supporting Prediction: 
   The domain in the provided url and the final url visited doesn't match the legitimate Microsoft domain.
   The design of this webpage closely mimics the design of the official Microsoft login page when this domain of this webpage is not from the official Microsoft domain, which indicates an attempt to deceive the user that it is the real Microsoft page without looking at the url.
   This would trick the user into entering his account credentials, thereby leaking sensitive info to a non-official Microsoft page, since there are fields asking for user's credential on this page.

 - Email
 - Passwort
4. Reasons that support prediction
 - The URL visited ('rewards.buchung.info.54-91-1-54.cprapid.com') does not match the official domain of DPD, which would typically end in 'dpd.com' or the corresponding country domain for its local branches (e.g., 'dpd.fr' for France).

 - The page requests for user's Paketnummer, Email and Passwort, which is not necessary to track a package.
