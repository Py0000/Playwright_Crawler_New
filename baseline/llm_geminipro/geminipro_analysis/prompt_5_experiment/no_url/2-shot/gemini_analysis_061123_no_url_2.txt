4. Conclusion: Phishing
5. Phishing Score: 8

 - The "Forgot Password?" link is a common element in phishing attempts, as it can be used to harvest additional information from users who may fall victim to the phishing attack.
 - The copyright date at the bottom of the page is a social engineering tactic used to create a sense of legitimacy, but it is not a reliable indicator of a genuine webpage.
