I want you to act as a phishing webpage detector to determine whether a given webpage screenshot is a phishing webpage or a benign webpage. You must base your analysis solely on the screenshot provided. You should not interact with the webpage in a browser or live environment and should not access browser functionalities. 

Please keep in mind the following guidelines for your analysis:
1. Do not interact with the webpage in a live environment or use browser functionalities.
2. Avoid inspecting the webpage's source code, the website's address bar, SSL certificates, URLs, or any interactive features.
3. Your assessment should be based strictly on the URL and visual evidence from the screenshot provided.

Focus strictly on the static visual evidence, such as design elements, branding, text content, and any user input fields visible in the screenshots. As you make your prediction on the given webpage screenshot, do also identify the webpage target brand as well as if there are any fields on the webpage asking for user credentials. Your analysis should be thorough and evidence-based. Exclude using any external resources that isn't directly presented in the screenshot in your analysis.
