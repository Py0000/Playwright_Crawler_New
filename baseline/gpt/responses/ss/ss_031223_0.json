        "Supporting Evidence": "The webpage prominently features the logo \"leboncoin\" at the top center, indicating the brand identity clearly. The French language used across the webpage supports the identification as Leboncoin is known to be a popular classified advertisements website in France. The content and styling are consistent with the brand\u2019s simple and user-friendly interface. Additionally, the copyright information at the bottom of the page, \"Copyright \u00a9 2006 \u2013 2023. Tous droits r\u00e9serv\u00e9s,\" further validates the branding as it matches the operational timeline of Leboncoin. The page lacks any fields or forms evident for entering sensitive credentials like email, username or password, further supported by the prompt that appears to be the completion of some process, rather than an initiation which typically requires credentials. The call-to-action \"Cliquez pour continuer\" (Click to continue) is visible and correctly identified as a navigational or action-inducing element setup typically used in web pages for proceeding to further steps or confirming actions. This direct approach towards user engagement without soliciting credentials aligns with common practice for user interaction on operational platforms.",

This consistent branding throughout the page establishes a clear identification. Additionally, references to Raiffeisen, including affiliated links such as \"Raiffeisenverband Salzburg\" and \"Raiffeisen Salzburg,\" reinforce this identity. The absence of any login sections or password inputs confirms that the page does not ask for sensitive credentials. However, there is one prominent call-to-action button labeled \"Zum Kontaktformular\" encouraging users to get in contact, which is why I marked \"Yes\" for the call-to-action present.",

Additionally, the overall color scheme and design resemble the commonly known theme and layout of Bet365's online platform. No fields for entering sensitive user credentials such as email, username, or password are visible in the screenshot provided. However, a pop-up for a download link is observed on the screen, which serves as a call to action, prompting users to engage with the content directly. The confidence in identifying the brand is high due to the clear visibility and typical presentation style of the Bet365 brand in the screenshot.",

        "Supporting Evidence": "The brand \u201cNetflix\u201d is clearly discernible from the prominent logo at the top left corner of the screenshot. The webpage design, prominently featuring movie and TV show artwork, is consistent with Netflix's known interface and branding. Furthermore, the screenshot displays a search bar and sign-in option, typical of Netflix. The \u201cWatch Free for 30 days\u201d button on the landing page encourages new visitors to sign up, which is a standard promotional approach used by Netflix in their marketing. The lower part of the screenshot includes links that are characteristic of Netflix\u2019s footer, such as account settings, privacy policies, and content categories like 'Netflix Originals.'",

At the top of the page, the logo reading \"GARENA FREE FIRE\" is highly visible, featuring stylized text typical of the game\u2019s branding. Furthermore, the characters displayed in the graphic styles are consistent with those known from the Free Fire game, reinforcing the brand association. Elements such as in-game items and themed backgrounds correlate well with recognized aspects of the Free Fire universe. This combination of visual and textual elements supports the identification of the game\u2019s brand. Despite the high confidence, it's slightly less than maximum due to potential customization or localized versions of the game that might slightly vary in presentation but still represent the same brand.",

This logo is used both in the header and footer, which typically signifies the brand of the website. Additionally, the webpage layout, content, and graphics consistently display the logo and mention the brand name, especially in context with investment services and account creation, further validating the brand identity. The presence of fields asking for sensitive user credentials (full name, email address, phone number) and the presence of a clear call-to-action (\"Create Account\" button) are visible in the screenshot and contribute to the functions and user interactions likely intended by the website.",

The layout features individual messages with timestamps, profile pictures besides the contact numbers, and color scheme used (light green header and chat bubble), standards in the WhatsApp user interface. The crucial evidence is the mention of \"end-to-end encryption\" related to messages not being readable by anyone outside the chat, reflecting WhatsApp's well-known privacy features. The content within the interface is consistent with WhatsApp\u2019s messaging application capabilities, and the interface aligns visually and functionally with WhatsApp's design ethos, adding to the confidence level. The visibility of groups and linking directly to a group (noted from the \"+62 895-0955-6668 bergabung menggunakan tautan undangan grup ini\") commonly seen in WhatsApp groups supports the identification.",

The logo \"Poste Italiane\" on the top left corner, paired with the distinctive yellow and blue color scheme typical of Poste Italiane\u2019s branding, are significant indicators of the brand. Additionally, the content asks users to \"PROSEGUI\" which involves further interaction or confirmation, typically seen in login panels or verification processes on the official websites of major institutions like Poste Italiane. The mention of Poste 2023 in the fine print at the bottom further corroborates the brand identity. The domain relevance to Italian postal and bank services, along with the invitation to input username and password, adds to this evidence.",
