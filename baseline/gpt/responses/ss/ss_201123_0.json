The logo is featured twice, once as an independent logo and a second time on a building, both in the recognizable Orange brand color. Additional support comes from the direct use of \"Boutique Orange\" in the menu, which directly references the brand. The color scheme of the website uses orange heavily, aligning with the company's branding. The presence of the \"R\u00e9gler ma facture\" (Pay my bill) button suggests a typical function you'd expect on a telecommunications provider's website, which is consistent with Orange's business scope.
