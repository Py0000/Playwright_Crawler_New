        "Supporting Evidence": "The screenshot prominently features the DHL logo multiple times, including on a pop-up window titled \"DHL International Worldwide.\" This window requests user credentials for login purposes, which explicitly asks for an \"Email Address\" and \"Password.\" Moreover, the background clearly displays the brand's signature yellow and red colors, an airplane featuring the DHL branding, and an airport handler wearing a uniform with the DHL logo. All these elements strongly affirm the identity of the website as belonging to DHL. The existence of a \"Continue\" button directly under the fields for email and password acts as a primary call-to-action for user interaction.",
