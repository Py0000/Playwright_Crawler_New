        "Supporting Evidence": "The screenshot prominently displays the Netflix logo at the top-left corner and throughout the page. The theme and messaging around streaming movies and TV shows align with Netflix's known service offerings. Phrases like \"Unlimited movies, TV shows and more.\" and \"Download your shows to watch offline.\" are consistent with Netflix's marketing. The visual design featuring a dark background with red accents is characteristic of the Netflix brand. Furthermore, the call-to-action button \u201cGet Started\u201d next to a field for entering an email address suggests user engagement typical for Netflix's subscription model.",

The logo is repeated twice in this section, underlining its association with the webpage. The page title \"Bienvenue sur le site Fonds Desjardins\" further solidifies this identification. Additionally, the footer of the webpage includes copyright information affirming the brand name, further substantiating that this is a Desjardins-delegated page. Additionally, the URL or web address seen in the browser\u2019s address bar often aids in confirming the page's ownership, although it is not explicitly visible in this screenshot.",

The repeated use of the \"QUADEL\" logo, visible on products and further down near the footer, supports recognition. The snapshot does not show any input fields typically used for sensitive user credentials like passwords or email addresses but does have visible call-to-action buttons related to contacting the center and following their social media, which signifies active user engagement points. The absence of traditional login or input forms supports the conclusion regarding lack of credentials' solicitation.",

The page includes a logo at the bottom right corner, which resembles a stylized 'C' and 'P', likely standing for 'Coalition Print', a hypothetical brand for this context but not identifiable to any known or specific brand. Additionally, neither the style of the page nor the layout associates directly with recognizable webmail service providers like Gmail, Yahoo Mail, or Outlook. Thus, without anything else to clearly identify a specific company or brand, the confidence in attributing this page to a distinct brand is non-existent.",
