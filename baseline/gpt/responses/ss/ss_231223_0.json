The presence of the Netflix logo provides strong visual confirmation of the webpage's brand identity. Additionally, the webpage content, such as the promotion of unlimited movies, TV shows, along with the familiar user interface design and color scheme of red, black, and white, which are synonymous with Netflix, reaffirms that this is a Netflix webpage. Moreover, the particular call to action to \"Get Started\" further supports its identity as a service sign-up or login page associated with the brand. Multiple instances of the logo and branding elements across the webpage solidify the identification. The inclusion of a specific area for entering an email address to get started, confirms the presence of user credential fields.
