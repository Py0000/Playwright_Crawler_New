There are also links to Apple's App Store and Google Play, suggesting a prompt to download the bit application. The webpage primarily appears to promote an app rather than requiring user login credentials, hence the absence of fields asking for sensitive user information. The confidence in identifying \"bit\" as the brand is high due to its frequent and clear depiction throughout the webpage design and content.",

The logo shown in the screenshot does not match Telegram\u2019s official logo, nor does any other branding visible on the page conclusively identify the actual brand managing or owning this webpage. Thus, without a visible or recognizable logo or specific brand name directly tied to the webpage\u2019s content and only general information present, the brand cannot be conclusively determined.
