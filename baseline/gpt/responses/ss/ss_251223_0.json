Since the web page is related to a general cultural contest themed around Russian heritage and there's no identifiable organizational branding, it's challenging to accurately determine if there is a single brand associated explicitly with the events shown beyond the usage of a web development platform (Brizy). The confidence in identifying a specific brand is therefore very low, and hence, the used tool or platform (Brizy) is not necessarily the brand behind the contest or the content presented.",
