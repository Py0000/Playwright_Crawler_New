        "List of Call-To-Actions": "Promotional banners enticing users to engage in betting or join betting events.",
        "Confidence Score": "9.50",
        "Supporting Evidence": "The dominance of the bet365 logo in the top section of the webpage, prominently displayed with vibrant colors and associated with promotional content, significantly contributes to the identification of the brand. Although there are multiple promotional offerings suggesting partnerships or endorsements (such as Suncity Group), the central and largest presence of the bet365 logo suggests that this is the primary brand of the webpage. The layout itself, filled with enticing promotional materials around sports betting, also aligns with bet365's typical online presence, focusing on sports betting promotions. However, the absence of any similar branded web elements makes me slightly less than absolutely confident, thus the rating of 9.50.",

The call-to-action buttons for \"\u0110\u0103ng nh\u1eadp\" (Log In) and \"\u0110\u0103ng k\u00fd\" (Sign Up) further solidify the identification as these are standard features designed to manage user access to account-related services, all depicted in a layout typical to Shopee's style.",
