The website also features typical bank-related functionality, such as login fields for 'Username' and 'Password' and an option for recovering forgotten passwords. This aligns with standard online banking portals. There is a linguistic and thematic consistency throughout the webpage, maintaining the corporate green color scheme and bank-related topics. Additional confidence is derived from the presence of typical banking advertisement for a no-administration-fee credit option (\"\u0417\u0430\u044f\u0432\u0438 \u043f\u043e\u0442\u0440\u0435\u0431\u0438\u0442\u0435\u043b\u0441\u043a\u0438 \u043a\u0440\u0435\u0434\u0438\u0442 \u043e\u043d\u043b\u0430\u0439\u043d \u0431\u0435\u0437 \u0430\u0434\u043c\u0438\u043d\u0438\u0441\u0442\u0440\u0430\u0442\u0438\u0432\u043d\u0430 \u0442\u0430\u043a\u0441\u0430\") and a related call-to-action (\"\u0417\u0430\u044f\u0432\u0438 \u043e\u043d\u043b\u0430\u0439\u043d).",

        "Supporting Evidence": "The screenshot prominently displays the \"Codashop\" logo at the top left, which suggests it is the webpage brand. This identification is reinforced by the web design and graphic styles, which correspond to Codashop's typical branding. The page layout focused on enabling users to top up in-game credits (\"Free Fire\" diamonds in this case) is consistent with Codashop's known services. Additionally, the URL is partially visible, including the term \"codashop\", which supports the brand identification. The way the page calls action for purchasing (Top Up options and payment) and the direct ask for credentials (Player ID and email) affirms the primary function of the webpage as a payment gateway for digital goods.",
