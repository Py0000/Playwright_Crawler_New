Additionally, the bolded header near the top prominently displays \"Office 365,\" suggesting some form of official communication regarding Microsoft's Office 365 service, which is frequently used by educational institutions. However, the presence of the \"powered by ukit\" at the bottom slightly lessens the confidence, as it indicates that the page may be created using a website builder platform, but it does not necessarily contradict the identification of Duquesne University as the primary brand reflected in the content and labels used throughout the form.",

Additionally, the text \"Aankopen via Orange-Factuur\" suggests the use of the Orange billing system for purchases, reinforcing the presence of the Orange brand. The confidence in identifying Orange as the brand is high due to these direct visual and textual indications. The lack of fields for entering sensitive credentials, such as username, passwords, or phone numbers, and the existence of branding elements directly from Orange further supports this identification.",
