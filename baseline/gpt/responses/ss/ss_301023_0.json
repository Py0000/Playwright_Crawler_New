        "Confidence Score": "10.00",
        "Supporting Evidence": "The screenshot prominently displays the Telegram logo at the top along with \"Telegram\u4e2d\u6587\u7ad9\" which translates to \"Telegram Chinese Site\". This, combined with the visual design and content layout specific to Telegram, such as the display of mobile apps and other features related to the Telegram service, confirms that the webpage is associated with the brand Telegram. The page layout focuses on promoting and explaining the application, showing various user interface screens from Telegram's app across multiple devices. Additionally, there is no evidence of entry fields for sensitive credentials like usernames or passwords, which supports the webpage being informational and promotional rather than functional for user login or registration processes.",

        "Supporting Evidence": "The analysis is based on the prominent display of the \"GoShare\" name and logo throughout the screenshot of the webpage. Both the top and bottom sections of the image feature the GoShare logo adjacent to another logo labeled \"Meta.\" Although the presence of the Meta logo might suggest dual branding, the repeated references to GoShare, including text that speaks directly about using the GoShare platform (\"GoShare invites you to earn\"), imply that GoShare is the primary brand associated with this webpage. The consistent branding elements and texts across the page, including the domain-specific steps and information regarding earnings through this platform, support this identification.",
