        "Supporting Evidence": "The screenshot displays a generic login interface labeled \"MAIL CENTER\" with a simple envelop icon, which does not provide specific branding information. The screen contains a field for entering a password and a 'Sign in' button. The absence of a distinctive logo or any brand-related graphics or identifiers prevents associating this image with a specific brand. The minimalistic design is common among various generic or template-based webpage designs, making it challenging to assign a brand with certainty. Hence, no confident identification of the brand can be made from this screenshot alone.",

The interface of the app is displayed in three phones, matching the design style typical of Telegram. This visual consistency with the official Telegram app\u2019s style, inclusive of brand colors and layout, supports the conclusion that this is a Telegram-branded webpage.
