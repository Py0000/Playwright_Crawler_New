The webpage layout with a focus on streaming unlimited movies, TV shows, and other entertainment options aligns perfectly with the services provided by Netflix. Additionally, promotional material such as images from popular Netflix series like \"Stranger Things\" and mentions of device compatibility (smart TVs, PlayStation, etc.) further support this identification.
