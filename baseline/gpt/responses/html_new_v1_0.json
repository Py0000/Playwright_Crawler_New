        "Supporting Evidence": "The primary evidence leading to the identification of the \"MyKasih\" brand comes from the webpage title \"MyKasih Recipient Portal.\" Titles are often direct representations of a website\u2019s brand or identity, which makes this piece of information highly reliable. Additional plausible supportive details lie within the footer and span texts, which include repetitive elements such as \"2023 All Rights Reserved\" and key functionalities related to the webpage like \"Semakan Status,\" \"Soalan Lazim,\" \"Senarai Kedai,\" and \"Hubungi Kami.\" Although these are general terms, their presence complements the service orientation suggested by the portal title. The absence of other brand indicators in logo_alt_text and meta_description, due to their non-existence, focuses the brand identification further on the title text. Additionally, the footer lacks a specific name or logo, which typically solidifies brand identity but in this case, universal footer elements don\u2019t contradict the title\u2019s implication. The consistent use of language and contextual service offering (checking status, store lists, contact info) throughout the texts aligns with what might be expected from a recipient portal service, affirming \"MyKasih\" as the logical brand for this webpage.",

The headers text contains several instances of Korean language text related to session expiration and login prompts, which supports the idea that the webmail service is catered towards a Korean-speaking audience, potentially relevant for a company like WORKS MOBILE Corp. if it operates in Korea. The absence of other identifiable brands in key locations such as the logo, footer, and nav bar (listed as \"Not Found\") further consolidates WORKS MOBILE Corp. as the primary brand of the webpage. The absence of meta description, favicon, logo alt text, footer text, and nav bar content somewhat reduces the firmness of the conclusion but does not contradict the identified brand.",

The title, \"\u7acb\u5373\u767b\u5165\u76e1\u4eab\u5b89\u5168\u4fbf\u5229\u7684\u7db2\u8cfc\u6a02\u8da3 | \u8766\u76ae\u8cfc\u7269\", translates to \"Log in now to enjoy the safe and convenient online shopping fun | Shopee Shopping\", clearly indicating Shopee as the subject of the webpage. The footer contains multiple references to \u8766\u76ae (which translates to Shopee) in various contexts related to customer service, payment methods, and company information, reinforcing the identification. Additionally, \"\u00a9 2024 Shopee. \u7248\u6b0a\u6240\u6709.\" explicitly mentions Shopee, affirming it as the brand of the webpage. The mention of multiple geographic locations in the footer where Shopee operates, such as Singapore, Indonesia, Thailand, and more, aligns with Shopee's known market presence. The repetitive mention of Shopee throughout crucial elements of the webpage secures a high confidence in identifying Shopee as the brand.",

Further supporting evidence comes from the favicon URL, which includes the domain \"pubgmobile.com\" consistent with PUBG Mobile\u2019s official site, and the logo imagery described in the favicon link points to a PUBG-related icon. Additionally, the footer text mentions \"COPYRIGHT \u00a9 PUBG CORPORATION. ALL RIGHTS RESERVED\", linking back to PUBG Corp, the company behind PUBG Mobile. The remaining HTML details, such as meta description, discuss gathering rewards in the context of a PUBG Mobile game feature, further substantiating the connection to the PUBG Mobile brand. Although some fields were \"Not Found\" and hence could not contribute to identifying the brand, the available information from the title, favicon, and footer clearly aligns with PUBG Mobile.

The \"nav_bar_content\" lists several Apple products like Mac, iPad, iPhone, Watch, and AirPods, which align with Apple's product lineup. The repeated presence of \"Apple\" in both \"nav_bar_content\" and \"span_text\" further confirms the identification.

Firstly, the title of the webpage explicitly states \"Facebook,\" which is a clear and direct indicator of the brand. Additionally, the favicon employed is named \"2021_Facebook_icon.svg.png,\" suggesting its association directly with the Facebook icon widely recognized globally. This presence in the favicon section helps in reinforcing the brand identity suggested by the webpage title. Furthermore, the navigation bar content and span text also strengthen this identification; the phrases \"Create a Page\" and indications for users to \"Log in | Create a Page\" are specific actions typically associated with Facebook\u2019s platform, allowing users to manage personal accounts or create pages for businesses, celebrities, or brands. Although the logo_alt_text, footer_text, headers_text, and paragraphs_text are listed as \"Not Found,\" the remaining evidence provided is robust and consistently aligns with Facebook\u2019s branding and typical webpage content structure, thus leading to a high confidence in identifying the brand as Facebook.",
