Additionally, the header text mentions signing in to access AT&T Mail and Currently.com, reinforcing the association with AT&T. Currently.com is known to be associated with AT&T, providing further corroborative evidence. Although the favicon is sourced from Weebly, indicating that the site may be built using Weebly's platform, this does not necessarily indicate Weebly as the brand of the webpage; rather, it is just the tool used for creating the website. The absence of footer text and logo alt text due to them being labeled as \"Not Found\" does not impact this analysis since the conclusive references to AT&T in both the webpage title and headers text are strong indicators of the brand identity. Therefore, despite some ambiguity created by the Weebly favicon, the consistent mention of AT&T related services across different parts of the webpage strongly points to AT&T as the brand.",

Although no singular brand dominates entirely due to the co-branding context mentioned in the text, both Microsoft and DocuSign appear as integral identities associated with this webpage. The absence of distinct identifications like favicon, logo, or footer information that conventionally helps in solidifying a single brand's presence lessens the overall certainty of attributing it to just one brand.

The footer's span text also contains direct mentions of \"Valve Corporation,\" which is the parent company of Steam.

The footer text further substantiates the identification with a copyright notice explicitly stating \"\u00a9 2023 DPD.\" Additionally, among the listed legal and company-related links in the footer, \"DPDgroup\" appears which supports the conclusion that the webpage is related to the DPD group of parcel delivery services. While the favicon links to a different domain (https://www.brt.it/...), this could potentially suggest a partnership or a temporary usage of resources and does not overpower the other evidences pointing to DPD due to the consistent branding elements found elsewhere in the text. The headers and navigation elements further discuss customer-oriented services typical for a parcel service which aligns with DPD's business model, with mentions of parcel tracking and customer service functionalities. Hence, the predominance of \"DPD\" in crucial brand identity placements such as the title and footer, alongside contextual service references in the header, strongly indicate that the brand is DPD.",

        "Supporting Evidence": "The analysis of the given HTML script points conclusively to USPS as the brand of the webpage. First, the title \u201cUSPS.com\u00ae - USPS Tracking\u00ae Results\u201d explicitly mentions USPS, indicative of their proprietary tracking service. Moreover, the footer text also provides extensive references to USPS resources and services, such as \"About USPS Home,\" \"USPS Service Updates,\" and \"Other USPS Sites\" which lists internal links associated with USPS like \"Business Customer Gateway\" and \"National Postal Museum.\" The inclusion of unique USPS service terms like \u201cInformed Delivery\" and \"Click-N-Ship\" in both nav bar content and header texts further aligns with USPS's specific offerings. Lastly, the footer\u2019s copyright statement includes \"Copyright \u00a9 2023 USPS. All Rights Reserved,\" confirming the webpage\u2019s affiliation with USPS. Hence, combining these explicit mentions and contextually relevant evidence from the webpage\u2019s content, the brand is confidently identified as USPS.",

        "Supporting Evidence": "The analysis of the webpage's HTML information highlights a notable mention of the brand \"Boxmode\" within the content of a paragraph. Specifically, the text states, \"This website is powered by Boxmode.\" Embedded within the context of encouraging users to start their own websites through Boxmode, this direct mention suggests that Boxmode plays a significant role in the webpage, likely attributing to its creation or hosting platform. While other identifying marks such as the favicon, logo alt text, footer text, headers text, and nav bar content are not available for further validation, the paragraph is quite explicit in linking the website to Boxmode. This explicit reference carries substantial weight as it directly connects the website's functionality and potential purpose with Boxmode, indicating that either the webpage is owned or powered by Boxmode or serves essentially as an advertisement or gateway for the Boxmode service. The inclusion of an invitation to sign in using a Yahoo account does not necessarily indicate a Yahoo brand ownership but more likely points towards an integration or compatibility feature offered by the webpage, which further emphasizes its functionality rather than its branding. Therefore, Boxmode appears to be the most plausible brand associated with this webpage, albeit with moderate confidence due to the lack of multiple corroborating brand indicators.",
