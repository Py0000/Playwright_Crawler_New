The title of the webpage is explicitly \"Procter & Gamble,\" which directly indicates the brand. Additionally, the copyright line in the footer text categorically states \"\u00a9 2024 Procter & Gamble,\" reinforcing the brand ownership of the webpage content. Similar references are found in multiple sections of the HTML script including the headers and nav bar content, which mention navigating through different areas of the \"P&G\" site and explicitly indicate its association by mentioning \"2023 Annual Report\" and \"2022 Citizenship Report\" of P&G. Furthermore, the extended list of product brands mentioned in the paragraphs text (such as Tide, Gillette, Oral-B) are well-known as brands under the Procter & Gamble company, confirming the focus of the webpage content. The consistent appearance of the company\u2019s name across crucial sections like title, footer, and detailed context throughout the text makes the identification unequivocally clear. Combined, these factors provide a high level of confidence in identifying Procter & Gamble as the brand of this webpage.",

The title \"\u767b\u5f55\" translates to \"Login\" in English, which is a very generic term used on a multitude of webpages across various brands and industries, providing no specific clues towards any particular brand. Additionally, key elements that usually help identify the brand, such as the meta_description, favicon, logo_alt_text, footer_text, headers_text, and nav_bar_content are all marked as \"Not Found\". The only other piece of text provided is in the span_text which mentions \u201c\u7528\u6237\u534f\u8bae\u201d and \u201c\u9690\u79c1\u653f\u7b56\u201d, translating to \"User Agreement\" and \"Privacy Policy\" respectively. These terms are also generic and standard across numerous websites, offering no unique identifiers pointing to a specific brand. Thus, with the absence of distinctive or branded information, it is not possible to conclude the identity of the brand from the given HTML script components.",

        "Supporting Evidence": "The identification of the brand primarily comes from the title of the webpage, \"MyKasih Recipient Portal,\" which suggests that the webpage is linked to the MyKasih foundation or a related entity. This title serves as the major clue because it is usually intended to reflect the main purpose or affiliation of the webpage, contributing significantly to the identification of the brand. The absence of other conflicting brand information in the other elements such as the meta description, favicon, and logo alt text, which are either 'Not Found' or generic (like favicon.png), focuses the identification process on the available clear text data. The footer text which includes \"2023 All Rights Reserved\" is generic and doesn\u2019t necessarily point to a specific brand, but its repetition in the span text also referring to the \u201cMyKasih\u201d system (inferred from title correlation) supports the notion that all the content is under one proprietary brand. The headers and paragraphs are consistent with the functionality one might expect from a portal associated with this name, discussing status checks and lists (Senarai Kedai), which align with certain service offerings that MyKasih could plausibly provide in the context of a recipient portal. Therefore, the alignment of these elements enhances the confidence in identifying \"MyKasih\" as the brand of the webpage.",
