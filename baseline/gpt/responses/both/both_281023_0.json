Similarly, 'Connect wallet' and 'Receive' are call-to-action buttons encouraging user interaction and likely leading to pages or modals requesting user credentials. The prominence of the Ethereum logo in the screenshot, although suggestive of Ethereum-related content, does not alter the identification of the brand as TrustWallet based on the direct text evidence from the HTML title.

Although the page provides interactive elements such as selecting an app scenario for a preview, no sensitive user credentials fields like username or password are visible or mentioned in the analyzed HTML script or screenshot. The call to action can be identified in the option to select an application type and configure its preview. These elements, combined with distinct branding and consistent naming conventions in the page's content, affirm the webpage\u2019s branding very confidently.

Firstly, the screenshot prominently displays the well-recognized UPS logo at the top left, which matches the company\u2019s standard branding. Additionally, the title from the HTML data, \"Global Shipping & Logistics Services | UPS - United States,\" clearly mentions UPS, aligning with the company\u2019s industry and services. Further, the presence of a specific service like ZIP Code confirmation for shipping and delivery options in both the screenshot and HTML data aligns with typical UPS services. Lastly, the footer in the HTML information reiterates the company\u2019s name as \"United Parcel Service of America, Inc.\" All these factors confirm without ambiguity that the webpage is associated with UPS.",

The call to action 's'identifier' (to login) further supports this functionality. Furthermore, the presence of \"SiteBuilder.com\" in the footer suggests that the site might be created using a website building tool, but does not necessarily relate to the main brand identity. The favicon URL contains a generic path which doesn't contribute to the brand identification.
