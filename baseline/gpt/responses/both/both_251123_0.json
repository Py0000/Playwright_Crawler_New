Firstly, the webpage title directly mentions \"DANA\" followed by a slogan, providing clear textual evidence of the brand\u2019s identity. Further support comes from the HTML meta description, which describes DANA as a form of new cash and involves digital financial transactions in Indonesia, aligning with functionalities typically expected from a digital wallet or financial service which the webpage's content suggests. Additionally, the website's favicon URL contains the domain 'dana.id', which directly corresponds to the brand name \"DANA\". Although there is no logo visible in the provided segment of the screenshot except for a logo which appears to be of the brand at the top left, the combination of direct references in the HTML info strongly supports that this is a page associated with DANA. There\u2019s a button with the text \"Lanjutkan\" (Continue in English), suggesting a call to action, though no fields for entering sensitive user credentials are visible or mentioned in the provided information.
