Furthermore, the listed HTML elements describe typical Netflix services, such as streaming on multiple devices and a variety of subscription plans. The \"Get Started\" button mentioned in the screenshot and described in the HTML as associated with entering an email to either create or restart a membership indicates a direct call-to-action.
