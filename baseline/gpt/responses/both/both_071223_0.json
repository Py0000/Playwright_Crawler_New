        "Supporting Evidence": "The identification of the brand \"Valonez\" is based on multiple instances of its mention within the HTML script's title, footer text, and some headers, denoting it as \"Valonez - Valorant Accounts For Sale\" and mentioning the contact details like \"contact@valonez.com\". The webpage also displays a dedicated shopping section for Valorant accounts, aligning with the title description. The webpage encourages users to purchase accounts which involves entering sensitive payment information, such as email addresses and payment details, confirming the presence of credential fields and call-to-action for purchases or registrations. Hence, the evidence provided by the HTML content, alongside the visual confirmation from the screenshot, supports this identification with high confidence.",

        "Supporting Evidence": "The screenshot distinctly displays the \"bet365\" logo at the top left, indicating that it is indeed a bet365 webpage. The HTML information confirms this, with the title tagged as \"bet365\" and numerous mentions of bet365 in the descriptive texts and policies. Furthermore, elements like username and password are common credentials, and the presence of \"\u767b\u5f55\" and \"\u7acb\u5373\u52a0\u5165\" buttons qualify as call-to-action elements, which typically prompt users to log in or sign up. The consistency between the visible brand logo in the screenshot and the HTML title reinforces the high confidence level in the identification of the brand.",

        "Supporting Evidence": "The identification of Telegram as the brand is supported by multiple elements in both the screenshot and HTML information provided. The screenshot prominently displays the Telegram logo at the top of the page along with the name \u201cTelegram\u4e2d\u6587,\u201d which directly aligns with the title provided in the HTML information - \"Telegram\u4e2d\u6587\u5b98\u7f51\". Moreover, the meta_description confirms that it discusses Telegram's functionalities such as secure, cloud-based messaging across mobile and desktop devices and includes terms directly associated with Telegram features, like \u201c\u4ea4\u6362\u52a0\u5bc6\u4e0e\u81ea\u6bc1\u6d88\u606f\u201d and support across various client platforms. The footer and headers texts although labeled \"Not Found\" and sparse, respectively, contain repeated mentions of Telegram which supports the brand identification further. Further confidence is given by the presence of Telegram-specific features such as API access directly mentioned in the HTML headers_text section. This combination of logo display, consistent mention of brand-specific features, and clear text stating \"Telegram\" in multiple parts of the page strongly supports the identification of Telegram as the webpage's brand.",
