This screenshot also has a \"Your account has been restricted\" header which further hints at an account-related service commonly provided by major tech platforms. The context given about account restrictions due to violating community standards is indicative of social media platforms, which fits the business model of Meta. The presence of a password field indicates a credentials input requirement. A clear call to action is identified in the form of a \"Verification\" button, urging the user to verify or carry out an action presumably to address the account restriction issue. The evidence from both the screenshot and the limited HTML details emphasizing account verification requirements and restrictions align closely, reinforcing the identity of the brand as Meta with high confidence.",

        "Supporting Evidence": "The screenshot clearly displays \"WalletConnect\" at the top of the page and describes it as an \"Open protocol for connecting Wallets to Dapps.\" This aligns perfectly with the HTML title provided, \"Wallet Connect - Home,\" confirming without doubt that the webpage belongs to the WalletConnect brand. Additionally, the page layout and brand-specific elements such as logo, style, and content focus on WalletConnect's unique offers in the cryptocurrency space, specifically its connectivity solutions. Furthermore, the screenshot displays a \"Show More\" button, which is a standard call-to-action feature, enhancing user interaction by allowing further exploration of content. This element, however, isn't categorized as gathering sensitive credentials, thus reflective of no requirement for such information in the visible part of the screenshot.",
