The 'footer_text' confirms it further with a mention of \"\u00a9Hak Cipta Coda Payments\". The screenshot and HTML also refer to Codashop as a reliable channel for purchasing in-game currency for the game \"Free Fire\" without needing a credit card. The favicon URL including \"codashop\" solidifies the identification. The presence of a field for entering a 'Player ID' and an email for receiving proof of payment are indicators of credential fields while options and buttons like 'Beli sekarang' act as call-to-action elements, promoting immediate transactions.",
