A direct \"Confirm card\" button is visible, serving as a call to action for users to submit their payment information. The footer in the screenshot also includes text indicating it is part of Charter Communications, adding further credibility to the webpage\u2019s association with Spectrum, as Spectrum is a trade name of Charter Communications.

        "Confidence Score": "9.90",
        "Supporting Evidence": "The brand name is clearly identifiable from the top section of the webpage, where it is prominently displayed as \"Society for Participatory Action and Reflection\" along with the acronym \"SPAR\". This brand name is supported by the HTML title which reads \u201cSPAR \u2013 Society for Participatory Action and Reflection\u201d. Additionally, the text and graphical elements (like logos and headings) in both the screenshot and HTML headers_text contain consistent references to SPAR\u2019s activities and programs, which aligns perfectly with the displayed name. There is no evidence of fields requiring user credentials such as username, password, or personal identifying information on the visible parts of the webpage or in the HTML data provided. However, the presence of multiple \"Learn more\" links and a \"Donate Now\" button suggests active call-to-action elements, encouraging user engagement with the site\u2019s content or donation features.",

        "Supporting Evidence": "The brand is identified as \"Michael Kaufman Chicago Real Estate\" from the HTML title tag \"Homes For Sale In Sauganash Chicago, Homes For Sale In Sauganash, Homes For Sale In Sauganash Chicago IL | Michael Kaufman Chicago Real Estate\" and reiterated by testimonials within the HTML mentioning Mike as a professional in real estate. The screenshot confirms this by featuring the web page layout focused on property listings in Chicago, reinforcing the focus on real estate and thus supporting the real estate brand identity. The page does not explicitly ask for sensitive credentials such as email or password, but includes a search feature (Property Search) which qualifies as a call-to-action as it prompts user engagement without necessarily requiring sensitive user credentials. The confidence score is relatively high as the evidence from both screenshot and HTML title directly supports the identification of the Michael Kaufman real estate brand, though the exact logo and explicit footer or header identifiers were not available to confirm beyond doubt.",

        "Supporting Evidence": "The brand is visibly identified as Netflix through multiple indicators. The favicon URL includes the word \"netflix\". The HTML title specifically states \"Netflix India - Watch TV Shows Online, Watch Movies Online,\" which concurs with the known services offered by Netflix. The screenshot prominently displays the Netflix logo along with familiar Netflix original content like \"Stranger Things\". The user interface design, color scheme, and provided service details like unlimited movies, TV shows, options to watch on various devices, and references to customized children's profiles are characteristic features of the Netflix platform. Moreover, the footer text includes standard Netflix resources such as FAQs and links about account preferences and privacy which are typical on official Netflix pages. This consistency in branding elements across the screenshot and HTML information confirms that the webpage is indeed owned by Netflix.",
