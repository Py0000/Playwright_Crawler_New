The screenshot also includes several references to services typically provided by Orange, such as internet plans, mobile services, and customer service options like \"Espace client\" (customer space) and \"Boutique Orange\" (Orange Shop). Additionally, there is a prominent button labeled \"REGLEZ MA FACTURE\" which translates to \"Pay My Bill\", a common call-to-action on telecom websites for bill payments. The appearance of functionalities such as bill payment implies that user credentials like username and password would be necessary to access billing information. These elements strongly suggest the brand identity as Orange and indicate the likely need for login credentials, providing a high confidence level in the analysis.",

The footer in the screenshot also includes typical Netflix website sections such as \"FAQ,\" \"Investor Relations,\" and \"Netflix Originals,\" which are characteristic of Netflix's official site. The phrases in the headers and paragraph texts like \"Watch anywhere.
