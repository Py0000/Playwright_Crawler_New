        "Supporting Evidence": "The brand is determined based on the prominent use of the \"Coinbase\" logo at the top of the screenshot. This matches the known branding style of Coinbase, which is a major cryptocurrency exchange platform. The evidence is further supported by the context of the webpage, which involves entering a \"Twelve-Recovery Phrase,\" common in cryptocurrency services as a secure way to regain access to an account. The presence of a \"Continue\" button serves as a call-to-action, prompting users to input their recovery phrase and proceed, implying the collection of sensitive user credentials for continued access or setup. This assessment aligns with typical user interaction sequences on digital currency platforms, which makes the identification of Coinbase highly probable.",

Mail co-branded in the header of the screenshot. The presence of the Weebly favicon URL (\"https://www.weebly.com/favicon.ico\") might suggest a service involvement by Weebly in hosting or developing the page, but it does not change the primary branding of the website to Sky. The credentials fields are apparent directly on the sign-in form shown in the screenshot, asking for \"Email or Username\" and \"Password\". There are also several call-to-action elements related to the Credentials process, specifically a \"Sign in\" button highlighted in the screenshot, confirming user interaction to access their account. The precision score is fairly high due to the visible evidence aligning multiple components of the webpage to the Sky brand, although multiple brands (Sky, Yahoo, Weebly) are displayed.",

The favicon link directs to \"weebly.com\", suggesting that the page might be hosted on Weebly's platform, but the consistent branding throughout the page and header information points distinctly to Microsoft.

Additionally, the presence of both the Meta logo and its prominent display in the screenshot pushes the identification more towards Meta, however, without corroborating evidence from the HTML script that verifies the full legitimacy of this representation, absolute certainty remains moderated. The HTML title and span texts also provide some thematic relevance to account recovery (\"Pemulihan Akun\"), which could be related to services provided by platforms like Meta (Facebook).
